This post goes over how to grant full access to all public folders for a user in Microsoft Exchange. I recently was migrating all public folders from an Exchange 2010 to Office 365 Environment and didn&#8217;t have access to some of the folders. Consequently, this solution saved me a lot of time from doing it through a GUI.<!--more-->

### Command

Enter the following in Exchange Management Shell:

`Get-PublicFolder –Identity "\Root Folder Name" -Recurse | Add-PublicFolderAdministrativePermission -User "ctitus" -AccessRights AllExtendedRights`

This will recurse the root folder and grant all rights to the user you specify.
