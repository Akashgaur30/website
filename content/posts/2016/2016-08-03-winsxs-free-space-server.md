Run the following commands if you are running low on C: drive space. Generally, this is caused by windows updates and you need to clear WinSxS free space. Do this in your PowerShell prompt and you will free up a substantial amount of space.<!--more-->

_Please Note: You have to run updates on Windows Server 2008 if you are far behind and these commands don&#8217;t exist!_
