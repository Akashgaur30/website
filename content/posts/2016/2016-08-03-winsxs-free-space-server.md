Run the following commands if you are running low on C: drive space. Generally, this is caused by windows updates and you need to clear WinSxS free space. Do this in your PowerShell prompt and you will free up a substantial amount of space.<!--more-->

_Please Note: You have to run updates on Windows Server 2008 if you are far behind and these commands don&#8217;t exist!_

MASTER CLEANUP: (Run this First)
  
`Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /SPSuperseded`

FOLLOWUP:
  
```
Windows 2008 Use: Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup
Windows 2012 Use: Dism.exe /online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup /ResetBase
```
