When re-attaching a SR on a fresh VM, I ran into this XenServer tapdisk error. I ran the following from XenServer console to eject all CD drives on that host. I was then able to start the VM with the old image.<!--more-->

`xe vm-cd-eject --multiple`

If your XenCenter hangs or becomes unresponsive, you can also reset the toolstack from console from a PuTTy session or if XenCenter console is working running the following command:

`xe-toolstack-restart`

It&#8217;s important to note what caused the XenServer tapdiskÂ error. I experienced this on an old version of XenServer 6 when switching out the ISOs from the VMs.
