Use the commands below to create swap file on a micro instance with a Linux operating system. This creates a 2GB Swap file to help alleviateÂ low system ram. Consequently, this is great for those using micro instances in the cloud that have under 1 GB of memory.<!--more-->

### Commands

Run the following from your SSH window
  
```
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
sudo swapon -s`
```
then change fstab (**/etc/fstab**) so it automatically mounts your swap file on startup
  
`/swapfile none swap sw 0 0`

Afterward, check if your swap file is operating properly with`top` or `htop`.
