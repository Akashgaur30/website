### Moving to the Cloud

The following article outlines what it takes for a cloud migration to Google Cloud Compute, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure means. Most businesses want to move to the &#8220;cloud&#8221; but have no idea what that means. <!--more-->If you&#8217;re a small business you typically have a couple computers scattered around with one storage device. If you&#8217;re a medium or large business you probably already have several servers at a location in a contract. Moving to the cloud is often pitched to businesses using Software-as-a-Service replacing the current system with a web application that runs through your browser. While this is ideal, in most instances it isn&#8217;t practical. So you keep paying for a bloated IT infrastructure that is dated, isn&#8217;t as reliable, and unable to change with your business needs.

### Performing a Cloud Migration

Leverage Google Cloud Compute, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure to perform a cloud migration. Moving your servers will often end up costing between $100 &#8211; $400 per server a month depending on your environment. When you factor in that there is no capital expenditure,Â maintenance, or power costs this is a far cheaper solution than your current environment. You also gain a **SUBSTANTIAL** increase in flexibility, performance, and reliability. So why hasn&#8217;t everyone transitioned to these services?

### Migration Pains

The main issue is getting a cloud migration completed. It&#8217;s hard to find businesses, technicians, or engineers that will do the migration. In the end, you should be paying these companies directly.

_Pitfalls_

  1. Contracting a company that uses their own hardware and you pay them for substandard service and equipment on a monthly basis.
  2. Under-estimating the extended downtime that is required for moving to these services. If you have 30+ servers it will take months for preparation, transfer time, and deployment.
  3. Degraded service if you have to work in a hybrid environment. Working through a VPN for an extended time that it takes to complete the full migration.
  4. Mass Storage &#8211; Most of the cost of using these services come from storage, and typically it&#8217;s not till you hit the petabytes that you&#8217;d run into ROI issues. As a general rule of thumb, anything less than 1000 Terabytes is more cost-effective using these services.

### Conclusion

I think every business should be leveraging this technology. The larger the business the harder the cloud migration will be. Small businesses I&#8217;ve done in the course of a day, whereas larger businesses take considerably longer. Stay the course and keep searching for talent capable of helping with this transition. I enjoy using all three of these major players in the market, however, for Website Hosting and Linux boxes I like Google Cloud Compute the most, and for businesses already running Office 365 Microsoft Azure makes for the easiest transition.
