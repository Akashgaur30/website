The following script shows you how to launch a startup program to run as administrator in Windows 10. This fixes many programs that require elevation and you don&#8217;t want to launch manually every time.<!--more-->

Almost every online tutorial I came across said to run it as a scheduled task. This is very cumbersome and I hate it, however using the following method is easier and saves you time.

Create a Text file in shell:startup and put the following in it.

```
Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell" ) 
WshShell.Run chr(34) & "C:\Program Files (x86)\File\Program.exe" & Chr(34), 0 
Set WshShell = Nothing
```

Now save the file as ProgramName.vbs

You are done! Reboot and see that program launch.
