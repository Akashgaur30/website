Trying to Debloat Windows 10 is getting ridiculous and as a system admin it is soul crushing to see all that performance go to waste on the botched attempt by Microsoft to do an Appstore and its apps (I&#8217;m looking at you Candy Crush). Luckily some admins have worked tirelessly to give us a solution that works considerably well. Lets Start! <!--more-->

  * Right Click Windows Button ->Select Powershell Prompt (Admin) OR Select Command Prompt (Admin) 
      * _Note: If you don&#8217;t have PowerShell and only command prompt open command prompt (admin) and type &#8220;_powershell_&#8220;_
  * Change Execution policy to allow a debloat script to run in Powershell `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`
  * Run the script from the following Github Repository. The person running this GitHub has been updating this script for a while and is a godsend. (Source: <https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater>) Use Windows10Debloater.ps1from the location above 
      * _During installation select yes to debloat windows 10, select yes to remove OneDrive, and Yes to reboot after it finishes. Below is the image of performing these tasks._
