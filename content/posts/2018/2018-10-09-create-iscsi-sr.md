In the end, we now have a centralized storage system that all our hosts can put their VMs on. This is key for using high availability, Xen Orchestra, and quick migrations. Remember to use the community-driven XenServer @ <https://xcp-ng.org/>, therefore you can get all the enterprise features of XenServer in your lab environment.
