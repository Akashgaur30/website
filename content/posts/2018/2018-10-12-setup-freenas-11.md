This article goes over how to setup FreeNAS 11 and configure it. These are the basic steps so you can have a reliable network storage at your house. <!--more-->

## Steps to setup FreeNAS 11

  1. Download FreeNAS stable from <http://www.freenas.org/download-freenas-release/>
  2. Create Thumb drive from iso and Win32DiskImager <https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/> 
      * _Note: DO NOT use Rufus or Yumi as these won&#8217;t create a bootable thumb drive_
  3. Install and Follow the Prompts
  4. Set Static IP
  5. Reboot
  6. Login to Web Interface with IP from Step 4
  7. Set up Storage Pool
  8. Assign SMB Share 
      * Make sure allow guest access  is checked

This will get you set up for a reliable network-attached storage in your home environment. Remember once you are finished to clone and image the USB FreeNAS drive. These USB Drives typically only last a couple years, so a backup is a must! In the end, FreeNAS is far more reliable than other commercial NAS products because of ZFS and its versatility.

For further configuration, I highly recommend checking out the FreeNAS wiki for using some of its more advanced features.
