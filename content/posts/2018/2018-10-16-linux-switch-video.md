This will be the first article in a series of Linux articles, I am going over 6 reasons to switch to Linux and 1 big reason not to. Many people ask &#8220;Why should I switch to Linux from Windows?&#8221; and in this article below I break it down for you. <!--more-->

### Pros

  1. It&#8217;s Free &#8211; Tons of Free software
  2. No big brother &#8211; Microsoft Telemetry reports on you!
  3. Stable &#8211; Can go months or even years before rebooting
  4. Works on anything &#8211; Pretty much any piece of hard will run Linux.
  5. Updates the way you WANT!
  6. Virus/malware resistant

### Cons

  1. Windows only software 
      * Microsoft Office
      * Adobe Software Suite
      * Specific Games
