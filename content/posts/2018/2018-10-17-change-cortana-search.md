This article goes over how to change Cortana search engine to display results in chrome instead of Microsoft Edge. Afterward, theÂ second part requires you to install a chrome extension to search in Google instead of Bing. <!--more-->

## Steps to Change Cortana Search (Updated)

  * Open up Chrometana Pro Google Store Extension and Install (Link Above)
  * Install EdgeDeflector (On Page after Extension Installed) 
      * _Note: SearchWithMyBrowser is no longer needed as EdgeDeflector takes its place_
  * Open Webpage and select EdgeDeflector.exe for default open with application
  * Done!

In the end, you need to watch out for Windows updates. Anytime Windows does a major update, be prepared to repeat the process above, as it will reset it to Edge. Therefore, I&#8217;d bookmark the Chrometana Pro page or this one as you will be coming back to do this about twice a year. If you don&#8217;t want to do this, you can always switch to Linux. Consequently, I have written an article about the pro&#8217;s and con&#8217;s of such a switch and I highly recommend the switch if you are able.
