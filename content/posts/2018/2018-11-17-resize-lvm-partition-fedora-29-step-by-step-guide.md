In this guide, I show you how to Resize LVM Partition in Fedora 29. I recently ran out of space and had to clone my install from a 120SSD ssd to a 240 GB SSD. <!--more-->I first had issues with boot timing out and causing the /dev/mapper/home, /dev/mapper/swap, and /dev/mapper/root not being found. To fix this, I simply rebooted to the rescue kernel and ran `dracut --regenerate-all -f` to resolve this in Single-User Mode.

#### Disclaimer: All these commands are done in Single-User Mode, therefore this will NOT work on a regular desktop.

Upon reboot, I found that I now can see all the space on the drive, but needed to resize the LVM Partition.

### Resize LVM Partition

First, we need to identify the LVM Partition we need to expand. In my case, it was my home directory that was running low on space.
  
Command: `df -h`

Second, lets verify there is space to expand on the physical drive.
  
Command: `vgdisplay`

![lvm-selection9](/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Selection_009.png)

With all this verified, you can now expand the lvm partition.  
_Note: the command below will take up a 100% of the free space, see screenshot for precise extentsion._
  
Command: `lvextend -l 100%FREE /dev/fedora/home`

Finally, with the logical volume extended we simply reclaim the free space now.
  
Command: `resize2fs /dev/fedora/home`
