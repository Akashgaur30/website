In this book, I go over step by step the entire Manjaro Architect installation. This guide is suitable for any knowledge level from beginner to expert. <!--more-->I published &#8220;The Complete Manjaro Architect Installation Guide&#8221; on Amazon so, if you are installing on your main PC you can follow along without constantly scrolling through on your phone trying to find what you are looking for. I highly recommend watching the video below, and doing a trial of Manjaro Architect in a virtual machine to familiarize yourself with it.
