In this article, I am going over the aptitude command and explaining all of the commands and usage that goes with its usage. <!--more-->

### Install Aptitude

Run the following command to install aptitude and task select: **sudo apt install aptitude tasksel**

## Why Aptitude?

Aptitude provides greater dependency resolution and wildcard installations. Making installing or reinstalling entire packages far easier. For instance the following command installs KDE in a simple command: `aptitude install ~t^desktop$ ~t^kde-desktop$`

### **aptitude install**

  * install one or more packages:
      * `sudo aptitude install gedit`
  * remove a package
      * `sudo aptitude install gedit`
  * purge a package
      * `sudo aptitude install gedit_`
  * hold a package at its current version
      * `sudo aptitude install gedit=`
  * build dependencies for a package
      * `sudo aptitude install gedit&BD`

### aptitude remove, purge, reinstall

These are the same as using the above commands under install, however, you can utilizing these independent commands with wildcards like below

  * `sudo aptitude purge ^kde-desktop$`

### aptitude hold, unhold, keep

  * hold is the same as the install, but again I like to use this long hand version when utilizing wildcards. 
  * **unhold** &#8211; is a great way to release held packages
  * **keep** &#8211; I **DO NOT USE** because it merely cancelled scheduled tasks for that package&#8230; only it will continue to be upgraded later. 

### aptitude update, safe-upgrade, full-upgrade

  * **update** &#8211; updates the cache
  * **safe-upgrade** &#8211; upgrades all packages but will not remove unused packages
  * **full-upgrade** &#8211; upgrades all packages but **WILL** remove unused packages
  * 

### aptitude search

  * **search <package>** &#8211; searches for the package, these search results can use wildcards, be sorted, and culled as needed using various options
  * search examples:
      * Search for packaged installed from outside stable repo
          * `aptitude search '?narrow(?installed, !?archive(stable))'`
      * Search for packages installed by the testing repo but not stable
          * `aptitude search '?narrow(?installed, ?archive(testing) !?archive(stable))'`
      * List installed packages
          * `aptitude search ~i`
      * List reverse dependencies for gedit
          * `aptitude search ~Dgedit`
      * show broken packages
          * `aptitude search ~b`
      * display packages on hold
          * `aptitude search ~ahold`
      * Find and install all packages with the name tightvnc in it
          * `aptitude search ~ntightvnc`
      * Install a specific version of a package
          * `aptitude install php=5.6`

### **aptitude show**

  * **aptitude show <package>**
      * displays information about the package

### aptitude why, why-not

  * **aptitude why <package>** &#8211; explains why a package can&#8217;t be installs because of a missing dependency
  * **aptitude why-not <package>** &#8211; show conflicts in which the package dependency can not be installed

### aptitude clean and autoclean

  * **aptitude clean** &#8211; removes all previously downloaded packages from the cache directory
  * **aptitude autoclean** &#8211; removes cached packages which no longer exist in your repositories
