This is a guide going over updating any PC to Windows 11 that "doesn't meet requirements" or doesn't use Secure Boot or has a TPM 2.0 chip. 
<!--more-->

## Upgrade Path

The path for upgrading to 11 requires you to have an activated Windows 10 PC and be subscribed to the insider builds.

Insider builds can be registerd for use @ <https://insider.windows.com/>

## System Modifications

Windows 11 does checks for TPM and Secure boot before it allows the upgrade process to start. However, these can be bypassed. 

*Note: It is important to understand Microsoft can at ANY TIME enforce these rules or ignore these modifications which means you would NO LONGER recieve updates*

Here is the registry edits that need to be made: (win11bypass.reg)

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\LabConfig]
"BypassTPMCheck"=dword:00000001
"BypassSecureBootCheck"=dword:00000001
```

*REBOOT AFTER MODIFICATIONS MADE*

## Upgrade

Now you can simply finish your insider build sign up and then click update

Once it finishes updating you should see a screen to update to the latest Windows 11 build (22000.52) or Greater
