This Guide shows you the easiest way to configure Windows and make an ISO with NTLite. 
<!--more-->

## Overview

NTLite is the best program for making an ISO for a Windows Environment. You have every option you could need, but is often overwhelming for new users. It's why when you pull up NTLite Guide on YouTube you get 30+ Minute long videos.

These options are great for IT Professionals, but for a normal user it is too much and most normal users just end up with a broken Windows install ISO.

That is where import existing profiles that have already been tested by the NTLite community comes into play. You simply unpack the official ISO, apply the profile, and make your custom ISO!

## Prerequisites

 - NTLite costs $40 for a home user and is worth every penny in my opinion. Download and buy from their website <https://ntlite.com>
 - Download the presets to import from my GitHub Repository <https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/ntlite-configs> - Credit for it's creation goes to Txmmy from NTLite forums. I'm using GitHub to maintain and update it based on user requests. 
 - Download the official Windows ISO <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10>
     - _Note: In windows it will default to "Media Creation Tool" to make the iso (see below) You can use Mac/Linux to direct download ISO or User Agent Switch Browser Extension to trick Microsoft_
