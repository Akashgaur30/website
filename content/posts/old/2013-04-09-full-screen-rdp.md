Here are all the hotkeys I use regularly when doing Full Screen RDP.<!--more-->

Full Screen RDP Hotkey:
  
`Ctrl + Alt + Pause/Break Key`
  
Activate Connection Bar:
  
`Ctrl + Alt + Home`
  
Send Ctrl+Alt+Del on Remote Computer
  
`Ctrl + Alt + End`
  
Simulate Alt+Tab on Remote Computer
  
`Alt + Page Up/Page Down`
  
Windows Key Press on Remote Computer
  
`Alt + Home`

I often find myself using theseÂ hotkeys to move around, but these are needed especially when you have a locked up program in an RDP session.
