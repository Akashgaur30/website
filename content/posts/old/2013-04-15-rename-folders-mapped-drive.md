This error message is displayed and I cannot rename folders on the mapped drive. By making a group policy change I was able to make this error go away.

`The drive that this file or folder is stored on does not allow long file names, or names containing blanks or any of the following characters: / : , ; * ? < > |`

## Solution: Create a GPO to fix

To resolve this problem, turn off Fast Logon Optimization. I recommend creating a GPO in your domain controller to achieve this. If its an isolated instance to one PC, you can use gpedit.msc to enforce it on that one PC.

### Group Policy Settings to Change

```
Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Logon\Always wait for the network at computer startup and logon
User Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Scripts\Run logon scripts synchronously
```
