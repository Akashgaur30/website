Here is the syntax for using the find command LinuxÂ terminal. The following commands are great to have in your back pocket when looking for specific files or directories.<!--more-->

How to find a file from the root directory and check the entire system:
  
`find / -name filename.ext`  
See directory structure without files (requires `tree` use yum or apt-get to install)
  
`tree -d /var/www/`    
_Note: if you don&#8217;t include the -d it will list ALL files and folders_

The two commands I use almost daily as they are fantastic for finding files or just seeing how a programs directories are structured.
