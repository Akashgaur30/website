Does your system reserve partition have a drive letter? With these steps, you will Hide System Reserved Partition and no longer see it when browsing your computer.<!--more-->

Here is the fix using Diskpart:

  1. Load Command Prompt (cmd)
  2. Load Diskpart (diskpart)
  3. List Disks (list disk)
  4. Select Proper Disk (select disk #)
  5. List Partitions (list partition)
  6. Select Proper Partition (select partition #)
  7. List Volumes (list volume) NOTE: Look at Drive letter of system reserved volume
  8. Select the volume to hide (select volume #)
  9. Remove assigned disk letter (remote letter X)

With this, you should no longer see it, and you willÂ Hide System Reserved Partition for good.
