To deploy excel macros on every excel file you open, you will need to create a personal file in your XLStart folder.<!--more-->

### Here is a step-by-step

  1. Create and test your macro
  2. Save as &#8211; Personal.xls (Macro-Enabled workbook)
  3. Copy the personal file to your C:Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office1#\XLStart folder
  4. Done!

I have no clue why the articles on TechNet and Microsoft&#8217;s Knowledge-base are so long when this is all you have to do. Â Other than its Microsoft ðŸ˜‰

Note: I&#8217;ve also heard of folks dropping there *.bas macro files directly into XLStart and having the same result, but I personally have not used that method.
