Thank you Nik for sharing! It felt only right to share his thoughtful email with a lot of explanations that are hard to find on the net.\nlaunchd Launchd is Darwin/MacOS’s init system. The init portion of systemd is heavily modeled after launchd, but unlike systemd, launchd isn’t a monolithic system manager but only an init system. It\u0026rsquo;s a relatively simple design that follows the unix philosophy. Any further functionality is implemented by daemons that can be disabled with a launchd override plist.\nFor info how to use launchd, check the man pages and read this document from the documentation archive: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/Introduction.html\nYou might also want to take a look at the launchd source code for a deeper understanding.\nI use Xcode’s graphical plist editor to configure daemons because I find it less annoying than editing XML with vim, but there are also light weight plist editors that don\u0026rsquo;t require you to start big ol Xcode every time you want to change something in a daemon.\nJob scheduling can be done either with launchd\u0026rsquo;s native tools or with cron.\nXNU XNU is Darwin’s kernel. It has a fascinating design and I highly recommend reading the source code. It’s a hybrid kernel that uses the Mach microkernel as its foundation and adds a BSD layer derived from FreeBSD and NetBSD on top to provide UNIX functionality. They are slowly turning XNU into more of a microkernel by moving drivers into the userland.\nThe nvram utility can set bootflags. I generally run all my systems with verbose boot, and on some, I also tweak Mach scheduling. I also run a special bootflag on my (jailbroken) iPhone to keep kernel memory usage down so I can assign more memory to my phone’s needlessly complex launchd setup. You can find lists of bootflags with google, but might have to read kernel source code for the more obscure ones.\nKernel sources for macOS 11 have not been released yet, so I assume it is currently not possible to compile a custom kernel for the M1 due to lack of drivers, but I haven’t tried it. The documentation archive contains a detailed overview of the kernel, but some of the information is outdated by now: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/About/About.html\nSmart Folders You can save Finder searches as a so called smart folder, where the found files will be symlinked into the folder. This is useful for a lot of things, such as symlinking all files of a certain file format to the same folder, so you can have a Photos folder that will contain symlinks of all .png files on the system. The symlinks refresh automatically, so when ever you add a new .png somewhere to the filesystem, it would get symlinked to this folder.\nAutomator and Folder Actions You can create custom automation routines with automator. Automator also supports a variety of shell scripting languages such as Python or Bash. Automator actions can be used in a number of ways, such as an icon in your dock that runs the action on any file you drag onto it, or as a right click menu entry, or as a folder action. Folder actions bind automator scripts to folders and execute them on any file you put in the folder. You can for example combine the Bash support of Automator with ImageMagick or FFMPEG to automatically add watermarks to any photo or video you save to a specific folder.\nAutomator also supports AppleScript, which is kind of a weird and arcane language, but offers many UI automization capabilities, that I frequently bind to voice commands for disability accommodation. It also integrates voiceover\u0026rsquo;s text-to-speech which I find incredibly useful to build notification systems for blind people. AppleScript functions can be called from Bash, so I usually just use Bash scripts and access AppleScript when I need it.\nThere is also a paid third party automization tool called Keyboard Maestro, that is supposedly better than Automator, but I don’t have any experience with it.\nPackage Management Pkgutil is Darwin’s native package manager. It does not support dependency resolution, and requires manual package removal, so it should only be used for things that you don’t want to uninstall like custom kernel extensions or patches. Darwin comes with the pkgbuild utility to create installable .pkg files from a root file structure, and can even build a customizable gui installer for them.\nMy package management workflow is as follows:\nI use macports (an implementation of the BSD Ports System) for applications that have too many dependencies to build them manually.\nI use xbps (from void linux) to build and manage packages of unix utilities that I want to use across multiple systems. This is the one I use most. I used to use pacman, but xbps integrates git nicely, so I can just run a git server as my personal binary package repo, and pacman was too much of a headache to compile for mac, frankly. I will probably eventually transition to using macports for custom packages too, but xbps just makes it incredibly easy to build packages, and I’m already experienced with it because of void linux.\nI use pkgutil to build packages for kexts, launchd daemons and system tweaks that I want to use across multiple systems.\nI use a program’s included makefile for utilities that I only want to use on the system that I’m compiling them on.\nI’ve been considering building a custom binary package manager with Swift and plists to replace this workflow, but I don’t know if I’m actually gonna do that.\nDirectory Structure The system partition is mounted as read-only in more recent versions of macOS, but if you want to tweak lower level stuff, you can either temporarily mount the partition with write privs with the standard mount command while in recovery mode, or run ‘csrutil disable’ in the recovery mode terminal to disable read-only mounting entirely. But make sure you keep timeshift backups around if you’re gonna mess with the system partition. I do not recommend that you ‘debloat’ macOS, and instead use launchd overrides to disable things like Find My Mac. Deleted system apps will just be reinstalled during updates, and they aren’t wasting resources while they aren’t loaded, so you don’t have much to gain except a few more megabytes of ssd space.\nEnable hidden files with command + shift + . and explore the file structure.\nUser-installed unix utilities belong in /usr/local/bin.\n/usr/bin contains the default tools. FreeBSD’s cpuctl is included and works with the M1. This can be useful to disable all CPU cores except one of the power saving cores, as a custom ultra-low power mode on MacBooks, but there is also a boot flag to disable CPU cores. Another useful one is firmwarepasswd to password lock the bootloader. I use that + full drive encryption on devices that I take through airports. You might also want to check out diskutil and its manpage for command line partition management.\n/Applications contains your gui apps. You can drag this folder into your dock to get a much better grid view than launchpad, or right click on it to change it to a list view, which gives you something like the Windows 98 start menu. Applications are folders that you can explore by right clicking on them in finder or with the cd command. Applications don’t need to be in the /Applications directory to be run, so you can put them on an external drive. They will not show up in launchpad or the applications list in your dock if you place them somewhere else, but you can just symlink them from an external drive to /Applications. Spotlight will still be able to find apps even if they aren’t symlinked to /Applications. The Mac version of QuickTime is pretty great btw. The windows version has nothing in common with it except the name, so give it a chance if you were put off by your experience with it on windows.\n/Library contains settings plists and libraries. A lot can be customized here so I recommend digging around. There is also a Library folder in /System for deeper configuration, and one in your home directory for user-specific tweaks.\nWindow Management I only ever use splitview for a terminal + safari combo, so I don\u0026rsquo;t mind that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer more complex tiling functionality, but there are a number of tiling window management plugins such as Yabai, amethyst or chunkwm. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any experience with those because I was a CWM user on the *BSDs.\nIf you have a mouse with thumb buttons, I highly recommend going into System Preferences -\u0026gt; Mission Control and binding Mission Control to Mouse 4 and Application Windows to Mouse 5. All non-mini macs ship with either a touch pad or a mouse that has a touch surface, so where you would use gestures to control window management, but since you don\u0026rsquo;t have that, it would be good to bind it to buttons instead. Mouse 5 will show you all windows of the currently active application, and mouse 4 will show you all windows and virtual desktops. You can also set up hot corners to emulate Gnome and KDE\u0026rsquo;s window management.\nSafari Adblocking I need to use Safari because it\u0026rsquo;s the only browser with proper screen reader support. I like it over all for its performance, memory and battery efficiency, but an annoying issue is that there are no good adblockers for it because it restricts the level of access that extensions have to your traffic. AdGuard (not on the App Store) is a pretty decent alternative that works not only on MacOS but also Android and iOS and blocks ads systemwide, but a pihole would work too. I also run Little Snitch (also not on the App Store) for traffic monitoring.\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

They are wildly volatile speculative assets that\u0026rsquo;s valuation will swing wildly from one moment to the next. However, This article isn\u0026rsquo;t about how much its worth or how much it will be worth. This is about it\u0026rsquo;s practical application and how it will change the world we live in. Just by having this knowledge you will be able to profit and be ready for that future.\nPractical application of crypto is all over our society today. Many banks are using it, and wealthy individuals are utilizing it. Here are the ways it is used today:\n International Bank transfers (Ripple) - Long wire delays and intermediary banking is becoming a relic of the past. Banks can leverage it to make trustless transfers between banks in seconds around the world. International Money Transfers (Bitcoin) - Want to send money to a relative in a different nation? Well using Bitcoin is probably the easiest way to get this done with almost no fees. You could send $1000 for less than $1 fee. Banking Replacement (Yield Farming) - Some companies are providing loans and holding crypto while passing along a profits to those holding crypto with them. Think of a savings account on steroids or collateral loans. Synthetic Assets (Synthetix) - What to trade Apple stock, gold, or other assets that exist? Sythetic assets are tracked using the blockchain and traded either for the said asset or for the dollar amount the asset is worth. Send Private Transactions (Monero) - Send money between two entities completely that is completely private. Please note: Bitcoin and other projects are actively tracked, while some are still privacy oriented, much like physical cash. Insurance, Data Backup, and all kinds of data that you will always want a ledger of.  How to Store Crypto There are two ways of thinking about storing crypto. You can either hold it all yourself or you can use a custodian where you rely on a company to hold it for you, much like a bank. Let\u0026rsquo;s address both ways:\nStoring Crypto in Your Wallet There are digital wallets where you can safely store your crypto and access it. They come in two types with different pros and cons.\nHot Wallets Hot wallets refer to software that runs on your computer with a password that protects the crypto.\nPros:\n Convenient Quick Access Fast exchanges  Cons:\n Security: Computer compromised or Private key theft Backups: If you lose your password or misplace your keys/seed\u0026hellip; there is no recovery.  Recommended Wallets:\n (Desktop \u0026amp; Mobile) Exodus https://www.exodus.io  Other advanced wallets I\u0026rsquo;d recommend come from the official projects or opensource on github.com  Cold Wallets Cold wallets refer to hardware that hides the keys so the computer never sees them, but you authorize transactions on the device itself.\nPros:\n Secure Transfers take place on isolated device  Cons:\n Not as Quick If you misplace your device, you can only recover things through a seed (phrase written on paper) Backups: If you misplace both the seed and device\u0026hellip; everything is gone  Recommended Wallets:\n Ledger https://www.ledger.com Trezor https://trezor.io  Storing Crypto with a Custodian These are companies that you are sending your money to for safe keeping, much like a bank. They can be insured, but none of them are federally insured like a traditional bank account. I lump these companies into three categories, on and off ramps, exchanges, and yield farmers. Here are my take and recommendations on each of these. Note: I like to use companies in my local country for regulatory reasons and safety\nOn and Off Ramp Companies Companies like Coinbase or Gemini are the two I use often. These companies are based in the United States and you can link your bank account to them to transfer Crypto to Dollar directly into your checking account. The fees are high and they should only be used for the purpose. While they do offer other services, it will be at a premium. Please Note: DO NOT use credit cards to purchase crypto! You will have exorbitant fees and it is NOT worth it!\nI don\u0026rsquo;t recommend storing money here, but they do have a good track record. If you only want to hold crypto and do nothing with it, then it is relatively safe with these institutions.\nCoinbase Referral Link: https://christitus.com/coinbase\nGemini Referral Link: https://christitus.com/gemini\nExchanges These companies are all over the place. The two I like the most are Bittrex(US) and Binance(Japan). They are the juggernauts in the space and when making crypto to crypto transfers they have the most options with the lowest fees. Many exchanges have been hacked over the years, so I don\u0026rsquo;t store any money here, but use it to exchange crypto. A good example is using Bittrex to transfer LBC tokens to ETH or BTC.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to use a company to exchange crypto, as you can use a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, but the fees are typically more. However, the convenience of not having to register with a form of ID is nice. Other exchange services like Uniswap exist but are centralized, examples are Simpleswap and Shapeshift, but they are starting to require ID (KYC Compliance) as well.\nTLDR: Don\u0026rsquo;t store money here, but use it to exchange out one currency for another\nBittrex Referral Code: 4KR-KYJ-BQG\nYield Companies For any assets held here you gain interest or \u0026ldquo;Yield\u0026rdquo; much like an APY % from a traditional saving account. However, they gain at much higher rates, from 2% to 20%. There are three large companies in this space, crypto.com, Blockfi, and Celsius.network. These companies are less proven, but do give you return for holding your crypto with them.\nBlockFi:\n More Reputable Direct Checking Account Link Web and Mobile App Monthly Interest Payouts  Celsius\n Only Crypto can be stored here and very few stable coins in Texas Only Mobile app Weekly Interest Payouts  BlockFi Referral Link: https://christitus.com/blockfi My personal recommendation\nCelsius No Longer Recommended (No Web App and Poor Customer Service)\nDecentralized Finance Projects This is where all the recent activity has been in the crypto space. I\u0026rsquo;m a bit skeptical about the longevity of many of these projects. I highly recommend not investing much money in this sector as I think it is a bubble that will pop. That said, there are some bright spots here that could definitely change the world we live in. While the practical application of these aren\u0026rsquo;t quite as refined as I like it is still worth paying attention to. The concepts here are revolutionary, but I expect some bumps in the road along the way.\nNotable Projects:\n DAI and Compound - Give small yields by holding the coins. Typically between 2-4% returns and these can be done in your wallet like Exodus or with a service like Coinbase. Synthetix - This wraps assets like stocks, gold, and other real world assets in a token. It has a lot of promise, but so far it is very limited. Uniswap - This is one of the first really successful decentralized exchanges. If you provide Liquidity to its pool you earn a % of the fees charged on the platform. Tokensets - Wrapped assets but with a twist. Both Human and Robot ran sets rebalance a portfolio based on market conditions. Still in its early days, but interesting. Yearn.finance - Blackbox setup with massive yields upwards of 30%\u0026hellip; seems too good to be true and I don\u0026rsquo;t trust it.  Almost all these DeFi projects are causing massive amount of Ethereum transactions which in turn is causing high transaction fees. Solo yield farming requires you to be making $1000+ transactions so your profits don\u0026rsquo;t get eaten by fees.\nMining Crypto Using a Graphics Card With the DeFi explosion and transaction fees going sky high we can make a profile with a good graphics card. Ethereum will be transitioning to Proof of Stake which means mining it with a graphics card will not be feasible sometime in 2021. However, until that time if interest stay the same or increases, mining will be profitable. Here is how I recommend mining during this time with just a single or small graphics card setup.\nProfitability:\n Check https://ethgasstation.info and if standard GWEI fee is over 100 then chances are you will be profitable Check https://whattomine.com and see current daily payouts based on your graphics cards Again\u0026hellip; Do NOT buy tons of equipment. This will dry up in the next year and will NOT make money  Basic Mining Process:\n Setup a Wallet using Exodus.io Setup an account with Mining Pool Hub Use a LTC Wallet Address from Exodus and Setup Auto-Exchange to Litecoin in Mining pool hub Install PhoenixMiner 5.1c - Forum Post Use the string for PhoenixMiner @ https://ethereum.miningpoolhub.com LTC will be autoexchange and withdrawn to your Exodus Wallet\nNote: Make sure to setup the Auto Withdrawl feature when setting up AutoExchange\nNote 2: Litecoin is used for minimal fees and fast transactions  I highly recommend https://minerstat.com for using a dedicated machine for mining. This will ensure maximum uptime and reliability.\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

However, it can be complex and also make using bootable USB drives difficult. Note: UEFI Boot Required\u0026hellip; No Legacy/CSM.\nEasy Way to Install 1 2  sudo mokutil --enable-validation # Remember the password! sudo mokutil --sb-state # Checks if Secure Boot is enabled   *Note: I used the enable validation on Debian based systems and it worked right out of the box\nHard Way to Install Hard way involves signing packages that aren\u0026rsquo;t stock which you might need on your system or if you dual boot. Check out the following guide from the ArchWiki: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot\nSecurity Settings for All Linux Installs I created a github script to make this easier but I wanted to break down what this script does. Secure-Linux Project https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/secure-linux/blob/master/secure.sh\nBefore running this script install ufw and fail2ban packages\nThis script is broken into 3 parts: ufw, sysctl.conf modifications, and fail2ban. Ufw stands for Uncomplicated Firewall and is fantastic for adding to every install. This script opens http and https, while limiting SSH to only a couple connections per second. The sysctl modifications helps harden your system by preventing spoofing and man in the middle attacks. Fail2ban is the final piece and possibly my favorite. This package see any traffic that is failing authentication attempts repeatedly or is malicious in nature (DDoS) and records the IP then blocks it for a period of time.\nOther things I\u0026rsquo;d recommend not mentioned\u0026hellip; SELinux! Look it up because it is amazing. You can also use this on debian if you\u0026rsquo;d like, but a smaller package called AppArmor is generally used on those types of distributions.\nConclusion This is not a all inclusive guide on securing your Linux system, but it is a good starting point that I do on pretty much every computer. I highly recommend you take these instructions and expand them to suit your needs.\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

This is a modular laptop for the raspberry pi that is simply amazing and showcases all that you can do with the pi.\nUsing Elecrow CrowPi Image The Custom Raspbian Linux that CrowPi uses is from https://www.elecrow.com/download/crowpi/. You can load this on any raspberry pi if you just want to use the digital portions to teach. It has a wonderful interface for learning Python and Scratch with code directly operating portions of the CrowPi2. This image also includes Minecraft Pi lessons which is fantastic for teaching and learning for younger students.\nProgramming Lessons The interface for learning both Python and Scratch operate portions of the CrowPi such as making a sound or turning on one of the LEDs. While you can load the CrowPi 2 image on regular pi\u0026rsquo;s without the laptop a lot of lessons would not be meaningful. That said the Minecraft section was fantastic no matter if you were using the CrowPi or not.\nOther interfaces such as Arduino or Microbit do require that component which isn\u0026rsquo;t included. Since both these products can operating pretty much anything you can think up in the real world, it makes sense that you\u0026rsquo;d want to purchase these parts separately as they will vary widely from project to project. I mentioned in my YouTube I wanted to do automated door locks in a future project which I\u0026rsquo;d use Arduino parts to accomplish.\nAs far as starting to learn and understand python, I thought this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best starting spot. If you or your student has never touched or seen python, I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend intro lessons from https://codecombat.com/ which are free and a great way to get your feet wet with Python before trying something like CrowPi 2 Python lessons.\nRetro Gaming The retro gaming aspect is something that is very familiar to the pi. I went ahead and did a custom RetroPie install only compiling SNES with Emulation Station and put that directly on the crow pi. If I were going to play a LOT of games on this, I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend using a dedicated SD card for Retro pi so you can get maximum performance as running the crow pi desktop and applications along with the emulators will take away from some of the performance when emulating newer hardware like N64 / PS1 games. However, If you are just doing old school games like NES and SNES you won\u0026rsquo;t need to. The one thing I noticed was that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t already integrated and if you aren\u0026rsquo;t already familiar with RetroPi this can be a challenging thing to add if you don\u0026rsquo;t know Linux.\nLearn more about RetroPie here: https://retropie.org.uk/\nOverall Impressions I love this laptop and am looking forward to making some lesson plans for the upcoming school year to teach my kids about it. This is the perfect product to experiment and learn about a variety of things in technology. Ever since the Raspberry Pi came out, I have been looking for this type of laptop to fill this need of showcasing all that the pi is capable of and the Crow Pi 2 exceeded all my expectations.\nLearn more about the CrowPi 2 here: Kickstarter Page and Official Site\nVideo Walkthrough \nNote: YouTube Video - Hold Ctrl + Left Click to open in new window\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

I typically run this on every system I setup, but I encourage you to fork this project and make the customizations that you need. Anything is possible, and everything can be automated.

Which means there are a lot of performance tweaks and improvements that you aren\u0026rsquo;t getting yet. This is why I recommend everyone install Custom proton as I find the releases a considerable improvement when gaming in Steam.\nNote: DO NOT USE STEAM IN A FLATPAK! You will lose some performance and modifications are more difficult!\nSource Project: https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom#manual\nAuto-Install Project: https://github.com/Termuellinator/ProtonUpdater\nFor Installation, we will use the ProtonUpdater script on GitHub.\ncd ~\rwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Termuellinator/ProtonUpdater/master/cproton.sh\rsudo chmod +x cproton.sh\r./cproton.sh\rVideo Walkthrough \nNote: YouTube Video - Hold Ctrl + Left Click to open in new window\nConclusion Doing these tweaks or just some of them will make a drastic difference when it comes to Gaming on Linux. I personally use all of the tweaks, but sometimes I end up not using the Custom kernel if I have issues with drivers like nvidia sometimes does not like it.\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

Here is an example.\n/usr/local/bin/wallpaper-reddit --save\r/usr/local/bin/wallpaper-reddit --startup\r--save option flag will save the current wallpaper to the default directory in the config file (~/Pictures/Wallpapers/). Remove this line if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to save past wallpapers.\n--startup option flag will wait til internet access is established and then download the wallpaper from reddit\nWallpaper-reddit Config File Settings The config file is in ~/.config/wallpaper-reddit, and will be created automatically. Currently, the GNOME, XFCE, MATE, Unity, and Cinnamon Desktop Environments should be automatically detected and the program should set the wallpaper without any extra work. However, due to the varying nature of window managers, it is possible, even likely, that you may have to specify a custom command to set your wallpaper. The program will prompt you for this if this is the case; the exact command can be researched per desktop environment. If your desktop environment is not supported, leave the set command blank and it will auto download to the ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/ directory as wallpaper.jpg for the daily wallpaper.\nConfig Options minwidth and minheight set the minimum dimensions the program will consider a valid candidate for a wallpaper. If --resize is enabled, the script will resize the image to those dimensions before setting the wallpaper.\nminratio is the minimal aspect ratio of the image. It is a float value of width/height of the image, for example 1.6 for 16:9 image.\nmaxlinks is the maximum number of links the script will go through before giving up.\nresize does the same thing as the --resize flag. It is enabled by default.\nrandom does the same thing as the --random flag.\nRecommended Wallpaper Subreddits  EarthPorn CityPorn SkyPorn WeatherPorn BotanicalPorn LakePorn VillagePorn BeachPorn WaterPorn SpacePorn multiwall wallpapers wallpaper  Chris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

It teaches you the proper way to setup your system to work long term in the macOS ecosystem.\nOpenCore Wiki Source for the content in this post is from https://dortania.github.io/.\nThis knowledge base is fantastic for any information I glaze over or troubleshooting that isn\u0026rsquo;t covered. It is much more indepth than this article, but can be confusing in parts. This article is meant to get you acquainted with OpenCore and fill in any missing gaps.\nWhy I Use OpenCore? I use opencore for compatibility and everything can be setup in a non macOS environment. It also injects drivers support (kext) differently than past methods and is far more stable.\nThis also means updates are far less likely to break your system and boot times are just as fast as a regular mac, if not faster. I also find a larger amount of hardware is supported and the finished product is all contained neatly in an EFI partition.\nHardware Compatibility Even with OpenCore supporting a lot more hardware there is still some hardware that simply will not work on macOS no matter what you do. Here is a definitive guide https://dortania.github.io/Anti-Hackintosh-Buyers-Guide/.\nThe TLDR of that guide is the last two generations of nVidia Graphics Cards and future nVidia Cards are not compatible, and even old nVidia cards will not work past High Sierra (10.13.x). Also, almost every Intel Wireless card will not function properly or work at all. So buying a replacement is needed for laptops. AMD CPUs can technically work, but will require more tinkering and are more difficult than the Intel counterparts.\nFiles and Projects you need to download and what they do Here is a list of all the files and GitHub projects that are used for OpenCore.\n OpenCore GitHub (Base Project) - https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases All Drivers, Kexts, and SSDTs - https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/ktext.html GitMacOS GitHub (Download Official Apple PKGs) - https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS ProperTree (config.plist editing) - https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree SSDTTime (DSDT Dump and SSDT creation) - https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime GenSMBIOS (Generate Serial and UUID) - https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS  Checklist for https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide  Check Hardware Compatibility - Document all device IDs and firmware Download All Projects and Files Boot Into Linux and do a DSDT dump followed by creating SSDT files for your computer (DO NOT USE PREBUILT!) Delete all files that your system doesn\u0026rsquo;t need Put all Your Drivers in the EFI Folder Note: I swapped AppleHDA for VoodooHDA on an old sound card. Do NOT just put every kext you find in one folder. Build config.plist and configure EVERY SINGLE Fold in the config.plist file to your computers specifications Boot to Installer!

All future launches should take less than a second.\nYou will then need to create a user account and password for your new Linux distribution.\nSet your distribution version to WSL 1 or WSL 2\nYou can check the WSL version assigned to each of the Linux distributions you have installed by opening the PowerShell command line and entering the command (only available in Windows Build 19041 or higher): wsl -l -v\nwsl --list --verbose\rTo set a distribution to be backed by either version of WSL please run:\nwsl --set-version \u0026lt;distribution name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;versionNumber\u0026gt;\rMake sure to replace with the actual name of your distribution and  with the number \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;2\u0026rsquo;. You can change back to WSL 1 at anytime by running the same command as above but replacing the \u0026lsquo;2\u0026rsquo; with a \u0026lsquo;1\u0026rsquo;.\nAdditionally, if you want to make WSL 2 your default architecture you can do so with this command:\nwsl --set-default-version 2\rNote: This will set the version of any new distribution installed to WSL 2.\nTroubleshooting installation Below are related errors and suggested fixes. Refer to the WSL troubleshooting page for other common errors and their solutions.\nInstallation failed with error 0x80070003 The Windows Subsystem for Linux only runs on your system drive (usually this is your C: drive). Make sure that distributions are stored on your system drive:\nOpen Settings -\u0026gt; Storage -\u0026gt; More Storage Settings: Change where new content is saved\nWslRegisterDistribution failed with error 0x8007019e The Windows Subsystem for Linux optional component is not enabled:\nOpen Control Panel -\u0026gt; Programs and Features -\u0026gt; Turn Windows Feature on or off -\u0026gt; Check Windows Subsystem for Linux or using the PowerShell cmdlet mentioned at the beginning of this article.\nInstallation failed with error 0x80070003 or error 0x80370102 Please make sure that virtualization is enabled inside of your computer\u0026rsquo;s BIOS. The instructions on how to do this will vary from computer to computer, and will most likely be under CPU related options.\nError when trying to upgrade: Invalid command line option: wsl \u0026ndash;set-version Ubuntu 2 Please make sure that you have the Windows Subsystem for Linux enabled, and that you\u0026rsquo;re using Windows Build version 19041 or higher. To enable WSL run this command in a Powershell prompt with admin privileges: Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux. You can find the full WSL install instructions here.\nThe requested operation could not be completed due to a virtual disk system limitation. Virtual hard disk files must be uncompressed and unencrypted and must not be sparse. Please check WSL Github thread #4103 where this issue is being tracked for updated information.\nThe term \u0026lsquo;wsl\u0026rsquo; is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Ensure that the Windows Subsystem for Linux Optional Component is installed. Additionally, if you are using an Arm64 device and running this command from PowerShell, you will receive this error. Instead run wsl.exe from PowerShell Core, or Command Prompt.\nConclusion WSL 2 is still very new and as such is still rough around the edges. However, the performance increase is undeniable and is a substantial improvement over\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

Let\u0026rsquo;s go over the install, config, and usage.\nInstallation of VIM Adding VIM-plug The first thing I do is install vim-plug from junegunn that has makes a lot of vim-based plugins. Here is the repository that I am using for this: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug\nInstallation curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \\\rhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim\rUsing My Custom .vimrc This is the main repository that has all of my customization to VIM. https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/myvim\nInstallation cd ~\rwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisTitusTech/myvim/master/.vimrc\rConfiguration of VIM  Launch VIM Type :PlugInstall Exit (Shift+ZZ)  Overview of Plugins Let\u0026rsquo;s go over all the plugins that were just installed. Feel free to edit the .vimrc to your needs.\nLightLine This plugin adds a nice look to the bottom part of vim and adding a colored line that is now displayed and changes when VIM enters different modes.\nOneDark This is a theme for VIM that adds a greater contrast and dark theme to vim. This makes text and everything inside easier to read.\nFZF (Fuzzy Search) This adds greater functionality to search that allows you to search for partial matches easier. See full syntax here: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#usage\nGoYo This plugin removes all the numbers and formatting and makes it easier when writing documents in VIM. From Normal Mode - I made the hotkey Ctrl+\\ to enter this special format.\nUndoTree UndoTree is an amazing plugin that makes it easy to see everything you have done in your session. Simply press F5 from Normal mode and you will see the entire all your recent changes and undo them.\nNerdTree NerdTree is a file management plugin. This hotkey is Ctrl+o and opens up a file tree on the left side for you switch files\nVimWiki VimWiki adds syntax formatting for markdown and is a fantastic plugin to have if you many markdown files.\nConclusion There is still a ton of other edits I need to make to this VIM and will be a work in progress for many years. Everyday I learn something new and powerful with VIM and if you can think about what you want, I am sure VIM will be able to accommodate that. Future additions that I am looking at is SpellCheck, VIM Tabs, and general improvements to the .vimrc file. My vimrc file currently has a lot of the most common tweaks, longer history, sorting, file numbering, and removal of auto comment formatting, However there is still a of things to improve. So come and check back often as I will update this project as it progresses.\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

With that said we will be going over the basic structure of BTRFS and the things you should and should not do.\nCreating a BTRFS Filesystem Create the file system on an empty btrfs partition\n mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda1\nNote: You will need to mount this file system after\n Now we need to make a subvolume before we add data to the device\n btrfs subvolume create /mnt/sda1 /mnt/sda1 is the mount point!\n After this is complete you can now write data to your BTRFS volume and use all it capabilities.\nBasic BTRFS Layout\nNote: Top Level 5 is root and isn\u0026rsquo;t a btrfs subvolume that can do snapshots and other btrfs features and therefore should not be mounted\ntoplevel root level 5\r+-- root\\@ level 256 (subvolume root mounted at / id varies)\r+-- root\\.snapshots level 256 (typical snapshot subvolume)\rBasic Commands  Disk free\nsudo btrfs fi show   Output:\n  Disk Usage\nsudo btrfs fi du / Note: you can make / any other mount point Scrub SubVolume Recommended running every week!\nsudo btrfs scrub start / Balance Subvolume for Performance\nsudo btrfs balance start -musage=50 -dusage=50 /\nNote: Use the musgae and dusage filters to only balance used blocks above 50 percent utilization\nsudo btrfs balance cancel / Stops running balance List Subvolumes based on mountpoint\nsudo btrfs subv list /home   Output:\n  Mount Subvolume\nsudo mount -o subvolid=267 /dev/sda1 /media/games\nOR add this to /etc/fstab\nUUID=IDGOESHERE /media/games rw,exec,subvolid=267 0 0  Snapshots Snapshots are one of the best things about BTRFS and I absolutely love them. They are incredible powerful and beneficial.\nSo Lets run through some scenarios when you use Snapshots.\nCreate Snapshot  sudo btrfs subv snapshop /home /home/.snapshots/2020-01-13\n Using this you can revert the snapshop by simply editing the /etc/fstab and changing the subvol=2020-01-13 or the corresponding subvolid you get from sudo btrfs subv list /home\nRestore Snapshot Restore Snapshop after reboot and successful rollback\n sudo btrfs subv delete /home\nsudo btrfs subv snapshot /home/.snapshots/2020-01-13 /home\n Now simply restore your fstab and reboot to be back on the /home subvolume.\nThe reason to do it using this method is to verify the data first. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work out you can simply change the /etc/fstab back and you will be back to where you started.\nMultiple disks and RAID Oh boy, here we go. This is such a badly misunderstood subject and if you aren\u0026rsquo;t careful you will be causing more problems than you are looking to solve. So with that let\u0026rsquo;s get into RAID. I will NOT be cover RAID 5 as it is unstable and SHOULD NOT BE USED!\nMust know commands for multiple disks:\n Add Disks before creating subvolume: sudo btrfs device add /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1\nAdd Disk to existing subvolume: sudo btrfs device add /dev/sdb1 /home\nDelete Disk from subvolume: sudo btrfs device delete /dev/sdb1 /home\n Creating the RAID File System:\n RAID 1: sudo btrfs -m raid1 -d raid1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1\nRAID 10: sudo btrfs -m raid10 -d raid10 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1\n Convert to to RAID 1 after adding disk to existing subvolume\n btrfs balance start -mconvert=raid1 -dconvert=raid1 /home\n I could put RAID 0 here\u0026hellip; but honestly you should just use EXT4 or XFS if you are looking for performance. It would be better than using BTRFS!\nVideo Walkthrough \nNote: YouTube Video - Hold Ctrl + Left Click to open in new window\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

Note: My Debian system had an old version of HUGO 0.40 and I had to update before the theme worked.\nChanging Theme Widgets Social Widget I first started to change the social widget by adding YouTube and Twitch from the following file siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/widgets/social.html.\nThe Most challengeing Part of this was the SVG files used by mainroad. However, once I figured out the SVG format can be edited in a simple text editor and I mirrored the size and types from the existing SVG files they showed up.\nHere are the Edits I made to social.html:\n{{- with .Site.Params.widgets.social.twitch }}\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;widget-social__item widget__item\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;a class=\u0026quot;widget-social__link widget__link btn\u0026quot; title=\u0026quot;Twitch\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noopener noreferrer\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;https://twitch.tv/{{ . }}\u0026quot; target=\u0026quot;_blank\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r{{ partial \u0026quot;svg/twitch.svg\u0026quot; (dict \u0026quot;class\u0026quot; \u0026quot;widget-social__link-icon\u0026quot;) }}\r\u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Twitch Live Streams\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r{{- end }}\rBasically after getting the SVG setup and putting the twitch.svg and youtube.svg in this path siteroot/mainroad/layouts/partials/svg I was able to get the Social widget exactly how I wanted.\nTags Widget Next up was fixing the tags on the sidebar. They were blocky and quite ugly, where I wanted a traditional tag cloud that you see on many other sites to help users navigate your content. So I began looking at other projects that had the proper code. I found the following code snippit:\n{{ if not (eq (len $.Site.Taxonomies.tags) 0) }}\r{{ $fontUnit := \u0026quot;rem\u0026quot; }}\r{{ $largestFontSize := 2.0 }}\r{{ $largestFontSize := 2.5 }}\r{{ $smallestFontSize := 1.0 }}\r{{ $fontSpread := sub $largestFontSize $smallestFontSize }}\r{{ $max := add (len (index $.Site.Taxonomies.tags.ByCount 0).Pages) 1 }}\r{{ $min := len (index $.Site.Taxonomies.tags.ByCount.Reverse 0).Pages }}\r{{ $spread := sub $max $min }}\r{{ $fontStep := div $fontSpread $spread }}\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;widget-taglist widget\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;h4 class=\u0026quot;widget__title\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ T \u0026quot;tags_title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;widget__content\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;tag-cloud\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;padding: 5px 15px\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r{{ range $name, $taxonomy := $.Site.Taxonomies.tags }}\r{{ $currentTagCount := len $taxonomy.Pages }}\r{{ $currentFontSize := (add $smallestFontSize (mul (sub $currentTagCount $min) $fontStep) ) }}\r{{ $count := len $taxonomy.Pages }}\r{{ $weigth := div (sub (math.Log $count) (math.Log $min)) (sub (math.Log $max) (math.Log $min)) }}\r{{ $currentFontSize := (add $smallestFontSize (mul (sub $largestFontSize $smallestFontSize) $weigth) ) }}\r\u0026lt;!--Current font size: {{$currentFontSize}}--\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ \u0026quot;/tags/\u0026quot; | relLangURL }}{{ $name | urlize }}\u0026quot; style=\u0026quot;font-size:{{$currentFontSize}}{{$fontUnit}}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ $name }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\r{{ end }}\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\r{{ end }}\rAfter replacing siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/widgets/taglist.html with the following code. The tag cloud was complete.\nHeader/Footer Modification Replacing the Header and footer was extremely easy as it is just plain HTML. The files are located in siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/header.html or footer.html. You can leave the stock, but I wanted to add a privacy policy and terms of service to be compliant.\nTable of Contents Changes I replaced the title \u0026ldquo;PAGE CONTENTS\u0026rdquo; with share buttons using a share-buttons.html I created. This could all be done in the post-toc.html file, but I wanted to keep it modular and not make too many edits to the theme. Here were my changes:\nsiteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/post-toc.html\n{{ if .Param \u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; }}\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;post__toc toc\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\r\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;toc__title\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ partial \u0026quot;share-buttons.html\u0026quot;

You could put Analytics in here as well, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t needed since mainroad theme has the option in config.toml. Here are my modifications:\nbaseof.html\n{{- if not .Site.IsServer }}\r{{ template \u0026quot;_internal/google_analytics_async.html\u0026quot; . }}\r{{ partial \u0026quot;adsense-auto.html\u0026quot; . }}\r{{- end }}\r\u0026lt;/head\u0026gt;\rsiteroot/layouts/partials/adsense-auto.html - NEW FILE\n\u0026lt;script data-ad-client=\u0026quot;ca-pub-000000000000000\u0026quot; async src=\u0026quot;https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\r_Note: Make sure to use your ca-pub-IDGOESHERE\nConfiguration of config.toml In your siteroot you will see this file that you will need to configure. Most users will simply edit this and away they go. Everything in this file worked pretty darn well. There was a couple spots that tripped me up which I will go over now.\nBaseURL Make sure you fill this out completely. I messed up the automated sitemap.xml because I simply put / instead of my entire address. This is what I have in the file now: baseURL = \u0026quot;https://christitus.com/\u0026quot;\nAnalytics, Social, and Title/Description All of these options worked perfectly and I had no issues.\nMenu The last problem I had was the menu at the top of my theme. I soon learned there was a syntax to the config.toml file that I missed. I simply added this to the bottom and changed the weight to sort the menu properly. Here is that code snippit:\n[menu]\r[[menu.main]]\ridentifier = \u0026quot;home\u0026quot;\rname = \u0026quot;Home\u0026quot;\rpre = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;i class='fa fa-heart'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\rurl = \u0026quot;/\u0026quot;\rweight = -110\r[[menu.main]]\rname = \u0026quot;Donate\u0026quot;\rpost = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\rpre = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;i class='fa fa-road'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\rurl = \u0026quot;https://www.patreon.com/christitustech\u0026quot;\rweight = -105\r[[menu.main]]\rname = \u0026quot;Remote Support\u0026quot;\rpost = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\rpre = \u0026quot;\u0026lt;i class='fa fa-road'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026quot;\rurl = \u0026quot;https://download.teamviewer.com/download/TeamViewerQS.exe\u0026quot;\rweight = -100\rNote: I added external site links and a proper home button\nTemplates to Optimze My Workflow This is where HUGO really shines and saves me a TON of time compared to WordPress and the like.

This will teach you how to modify lightdm to choose a default desktop environment, theme, autologin, and even a VNC connection.\nReference Articles:\nUbuntu Wiki\nArch Wiki\nDebian Wiki\nInstallation For Debian based systems, install LightDM by typing sudo apt install lightdm\nFor Arch based systems, install LightDM by typing sudo pacman -S lightdm\nActivating LightDM on startup Before you can enable the lightdm service you will need to disable your current display manager.\nFor disabling SDDM (KDE Systems) type sudo systemctl disable sddm\nFor disabling GDM (Gnome Systems) type sudo systemctl disable gdm\nConfiguration Start out with opening up your /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and this is where most of the modifications will take place.\nI will go over the 4 sections in the configuration that most will want to change or modify.\nChanging the Theme lightdm.conf\n[Seat:*]\r#type=local\r#pam-service=lightdm\r#pam-autologin-service=lightdm-autologin\r#pam-greeter-service=lightdm-greeter\r#xserver-command=X\r#xmir-command=Xmir\r#xserver-config=\r#xserver-layout=\r#xserver-allow-tcp=false\r#xserver-share=true\r#xserver-hostname=\r#xserver-display-number=\r#xdmcp-manager=\r#xdmcp-port=177\r#xdmcp-key=\rgreeter-session=lightdm-slick-greeter ### CHANGE THIS #greeter-hide-users=false\r#greeter-allow-guest=true\r#greeter-show-manual-login=false\r#greeter-show-remote-login=true\rInstall what ever theme you want, this is called a greeter in lightdm, and then change the line above. After the changes are made you can either reboot or type sudo systemctl restart lightdm Please Note: This will log you out\nChanging the Default Desktop Environment lightdm.conf\n[Seat:*]\r#type=local\r#pam-service=lightdm\r#pam-autologin-service=lightdm-autologin\r#pam-greeter-service=lightdm-greeter\r#xserver-command=X\r#xmir-command=Xmir\r#xserver-config=\r#xserver-layout=\r#xserver-allow-tcp=false\r#xserver-share=true\r#xserver-hostname=\r#xserver-display-number=\r#xdmcp-manager=\r#xdmcp-port=177\r#xdmcp-key=\rgreeter-session=lightdm-slick-greeter\r#greeter-hide-users=false\r#greeter-allow-guest=true\r#greeter-show-manual-login=false\r#greeter-show-remote-login=true\ruser-session=default ################ CHANGE THIS\r#allow-user-switching=true\r#allow-guest=true\r#guest-session=\rTo specify a specific desktop environment you need to change the user-session line to be your desktop environment. For example I use the awesome window manager for mine and I put user-session=awesome\nNote: If you don\u0026rsquo;t know the name, the desktop environment list can be found with listing .desktop file from /usr/share/xsessions/*.desktop\nFor complete listing of user sessions type: ls /usr/share/xsessions/*.desktop\nAutoLogin with LightDM Change the following part of the file to autologin. Note: This does pose a security risk and should never be done in a business\nlightdm.conf Under [Seat:*]\nautologin-guest=false\rautologin-user=username\rautologin-user-timeout=0\rautologin-in-background=false\r#autologin-session=\rI generally uncomment the following lines above and just change this line autologin-user=username and then it will autologin that user on the next reboot. Note: You can use the autologin-guest instead of user to have it autologin as a guest account.\nVNC Connection At the buttom of the lightdm.conf file you will see VNC connection information. This information uses the tigervnc package and also is done using secure channel. This means you must establish a SSH connection with a portforward before you can connect to VNC. Example: ssh 192.168.69.10 -L 9901:localhost:5901 This establishes ssh and port forwards your local port 9901 to 5901 of the remote machine. Then you could launch VNC viewer with vncviewer localhost:9901. Even though this says localhost it is forwarding the request through SSH to the remote machine.\nNow with that framework lets look at the conf file:\n#\r# VNC Server configuration\r#\r# enabled = True if VNC connections should be allowed\r# command = Command to run Xvnc server with\r# port = TCP/IP port to listen for connections on\r# listen-address = Host/address to listen for VNC connections (use all addresses if not present)\r# width = Width of display to use\r# height = Height of display to use\r# depth = Color depth of display to use\r#\r[VNCServer]\r#enabled=false\r#command=Xvnc\r#port=5900\r#listen-address=\r#width=1024\r#height=768\r#depth=8\rThe main things to change here are enabled=true width - height - depth and then you are off. My typical defaults would look like the following:\n[VNCServer]\renabled=true\rcommand=Xvnc\rport=5900\r#listen-address=\rwidth=1920\rheight=1080\rdepth=16\rVideo Walkthrough \nNote: YouTube Video - Hold Ctrl + Left Click to open in new window\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

You need to disable any unneeded programs from here.\nChanging Startup Programs (Advanced Users) You can change startup programs from Start-Run-Type:shell:startup and Start-Run-Type: shell:common startup\nYou can also modify startup programs using registry editor HKCU or HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrrentVersion\\Run\nCleanup Task Scheduler, as it accumulates many things that cause an install to be slow and is vital when you clean up Windows 10.\nStep 3: System Tweaks and Privacy There is literally hundreds of settings in Windows 10 that are privacy concerns and why I’d recommend using a 3rd party software for this. However, you can do all the same tweaks by simply going through settings and doing all these manually. That said, I recommend using O\u0026amp;O Shutup10 for optimal tweaks and privacy.\nDownload: https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10\nI also tell everyone to use the recommended settings as the other settings can have unintended consequences.\nOther Recommended Settings Turn off Hibernation: powercfg /hibernate off\nModify Applications Menu: explorer shell:AppsFolder\nChange Windows 10 Start Menu: shell:StartMenuAllPrograms or shell:Start Menu\nVideo Walkthrough \nNote: YouTube Video - Hold Ctrl + Left Click to open in new window\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

I will go over performing this in a Debian-based system and an Arch-based system. Please note that the arch based system requires you to build the kernel yourself and will take much longer.\nCustom kernels in Linux are based on the Zen project and have some workstation/desktop optimizations. They are NOT meant for server installations. These are meant for those using Linux Desktop and utilizing it for Gaming, Production, etc. and overall I don’t recommend using these. However, if you like to tinker and squeeze every bit of performance out of your kernel than you can proceed.\nCustom Kernel on Ubuntu / Debian / Mint / Pop OS Official Site https://liquorix.net/ for the Liquorix Kernel.\nVanilla Debian requires a bit of a long command to install the custom kernel, but works fine.\ncodename=\u0026quot;$(find /etc/apt -type f -name '*.list' | xargs grep -E '^deb' | awk '{print $3}' | grep -Eo '^[a-z]+' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n1 | grep -Eo '[a-z]+$')\u0026quot; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https \u0026amp;\u0026amp; echo -e \u0026quot;deb http://liquorix.net/debian $codename maindeb-src http://liquorix.net/debian $codename main# Mirrors:## Unit193 - France# deb http://mirror.unit193.net/liquorix $codename main# deb-src http://mirror.unit193.net/liquorix $codename main\u0026quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/liquorix.list \u0026amp;\u0026amp; curl https://liquorix.net/linux-liquorix.pub | sudo apt-key add - \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt-get update\nUbuntu, Linux Mint, and Pop OS! are quite a bit shorter for the install.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:damentz/liquorix \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install linux-image-liquorix-amd64 linux-headers-liquorix-amd64\nCustom Kernel on Arch Linux, Manjaro, etc. For Arch-based systems the command to run is simplier than all of the above. However, this is BUILDING a kernel and on a low-end system this will take HOURS.\nExample: On my AMD Ryzen 2700 with 16 threads and 8 cores, this took almost 60 minutes!\nyay -S linux-lqx\nNote: This uses yay as the AUR helper. you may need to change this if you use something else like Yaourt, pacaur, trizen, etc.\nFor modifying which Kernel you are going to boot in check out these videos going over modifying GRUB\nCustom Boot (Grub, Rescue, and UKUU) YouTube Videos The following videos will help you if you need to revert your kernel or setup multiple kernels to boot into your Linux installation. This is highly recommended.\nGrub Customizer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7qBJ-H7vw\nGrub Rescue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7meKJsjqfY\nKernel Upgrade with UKUU: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnn_MzosdwA\nVideo Walkthrough \nNote: YouTube Video - Hold Ctrl + Left Click to open in new window\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

In conclusion, this issue has become less of an issue with the newer versions of Windows Server, but can still rear its ugly head from time to time. It’s important that you keep these pruned and functional, due to the fact a large number of shadow copies will bloat your server. This also can cause massive performance issues that will lock up a server. It is very important that you keep these manageable and functional for each server instance.

After looking at the performance below, you will be able to decide which one best suits your needs.\n SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Advancement) * Most common\n* Least reliable\n* Slow * 5400 – 7200 RPM Hard Drives\n* Half duplex (Can’t read and write simultaneously)\n* 6 GB/s connection\n* Cheap (1 TB SSD $150)  SAS (Serial Attached Storage)  Commonplace in data centers Very reliable  Error checking is built-in   Fast  15k RPM Hard Drives Full Duplex (Simultaneous read and write) 12 GB/s connection   Expensive (800 GB SSD $600) – Pretty much enterprise only   NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express)  Common in new PC builds, common in data center SANs for cache on tiered storage. Reliable Fastest  16-32 GB/s connection when directly plugged into PCIe 12 GB/s connection still applies when hot-swapped via SAS connection Full Duplex Higher Bandwidth (Able to process the most at one time)   Expensive (1 TB Residential $300-$400 | 1.2 TB Enterprise $1200)      No real surprises here but having it bullet-pointed makes the comparison very easy. I hope this helps those trying to decide on what to buy and typical performance you can expect from it.\nSATA vs SAS vs NVMe | Performance Winner: NVMe SATA vs SAS vs NVMe | Budget Winner: SATA What about SAS? Well, in enterprise environments you see this very often with pretty much every tiered storage device having it. Most of what is on the market today is a mixture of SAS and NVMe for business. These hybrid drives are crazy expensive but give system administrators the ability to claim some of the speed from NVMe without purchasing entirely new devices. While this may seem trivial when you are talking thousands of dollars, this becomes a budget issue. SAS also has the error checking built into the interface, which in turn, gives greater reliability in theory. Personally, I think the future enterprise devices will have some type of new connector or housing that will make NVMe devices hot-swappable without the 12 GB/s SAS limitation. That said, we aren’t quite there yet, and the prevalence of SAS in enterprise space will continue.\nBy doing this you allow all traffic inbound to this computer, consequently, all outbound traffic is already allowed by default. Therefore, certain programs and services that depend on windows firewall can function properly.

This step-by-step guide shows you the requirements, installation steps, and basic configuration.\nRequirements  Microsoft recommends 128 GB of memory. If in a medium size environment (100-1000 users) 32-64 GB will be sufficient. Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2/2016/2019 Co-Existence with Exchange 2013/2016 that are up-to-date 30 GB of free disk space, however, you should have plenty of TBs of storage available for the mailbox stores. NTFS based file system  Notable Improvements  Exchange 2019 has the ability to now be installed on server core 2019. Exchange Admin Console – https://server/ecp – Refined and matches Office 365 layout Outlook Web Access has more features and a better look  Things I wished Exchange 2019 had  DKIM… seriously, WTF Microsoft. Office 365 has this, therefore exchange 2019 should have this!  Installing Exchange 2019 This was a breeze, with only 2 pre-requirements missing on a server 2016 stock install. The only configuration during setup was the role (mailbox or edge) and naming the exchange organization. Check out this video below to see the time lapse install:\nhttps://youtu.be/xmDOdkOKQxQ\nConfiguring Exchange 2019 Again, this was very easy with only a couple options needed before I was operational. Using only a mailbox role with no edge you only need to add your domain, send connector, and set an email address for mailboxes. Here is the basic configuration video:\nhttps://youtu.be/9n6JlEUS5fw\n_Note: Do not forget to add the MX, SPF, DMARC records where your domain registrar DNS resides. _\nConclusion I absolutely love Exchange 2019 due to the vast amount of improvements, that said, I am still bummed that they continue to not support DKIM through exchange server. Installing and configuring exchange 2019 was the easiest experience I’ve had to date, which is saying a lot! Overall I am liking the direction Microsoft is taking with the server line of products and I believe it will continue to have a very bright future, as long as they don’t do something stupid like including the Microsoft store.\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

This tool is one of the best tools Microsoft has ever created, so why? Well, they want you to use the Snip and Sketch App from the Microsoft Store. Spoiler: It sucks.\nGreenshot the best Snipping Tool Replacement So what should you use? Greenshot. Its freeware and it just works. Not bulky with a toolbar, but adds a tray icon, which you don’t have to use. You can just press print screen and away you go.\nDownload it from there website here: http://getgreenshot.org/downloads/\nMicrosoft Snip and Sketch Replacement Currently, this is labeled as Screen Sketch, however, this is changing to Snip and Sketch App in the next update. Here is the preview of the upcoming disaster for Microsoft their predictably bad moves on forcing their tragic app store on us. Here is today’s download image of the app prior to the upcoming update that sunsets our beloved Snipping Tool.\nConclusion With Snipping Tool gone, you might as well get used to something new, and Greenshot is a great freeware that has been around for 4 years. In the short week or so that I have been using this, I have grown to love it more than the old Snipping Tool.

On the plus side, I do like the new chrome tabs, so the entire update is not all bad. Also, the changes to default to secure sites has been a long time coming. There are many different reasons for this, but the fact is by forcing webmasters to use SSL and get secure is a good thing. These days non-secure http sites can easily be exploited by a variety of different methods and this is a welcomed change in my opinion.\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

Most businesses want to move to the “cloud” but have no idea what that means.\nIf you’re a small business you typically have a couple computers scattered around with one storage device. If you’re a medium or large business you probably already have several servers at a location in a contract. Moving to the cloud is often pitched to businesses using Software-as-a-Service replacing the current system with a web application that runs through your browser. While this is ideal, in most instances it isn’t practical. So you keep paying for a bloated IT infrastructure that is dated, isn’t as reliable, and unable to change with your business needs.\nPerforming a Cloud Migration Leverage Google Cloud Compute, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure to perform a cloud migration. Moving your servers will often end up costing between $100 – $400 per server a month depending on your environment. When you factor in that there is no capital expenditure, maintenance, or power costs this is a far cheaper solution than your current environment. You also gain a SUBSTANTIAL increase in flexibility, performance, and reliability. So why hasn’t everyone transitioned to these services?\nMigration Pains The main issue is getting a cloud migration completed. It’s hard to find businesses, technicians, or engineers that will do the migration. In the end, you should be paying these companies directly.\nPitfalls\n Contracting a company that uses their own hardware and you pay them for substandard service and equipment on a monthly basis. Under-estimating the extended downtime that is required for moving to these services. If you have 30+ servers it will take months for preparation, transfer time, and deployment. Degraded service if you have to work in a hybrid environment. Working through a VPN for an extended time that it takes to complete the full migration. Mass Storage – Most of the cost of using these services come from storage, and typically it’s not till you hit the petabytes that you’d run into ROI issues. As a general rule of thumb, anything less than 1000 Terabytes is more cost-effective using these services.  Conclusion I think every business should be leveraging this technology. The larger the business the harder the cloud migration will be. Small businesses I’ve done in the course of a day, whereas larger businesses take considerably longer. Stay the course and keep searching for talent capable of helping with this transition. I enjoy using all three of these major players in the market, however, for Website Hosting and Linux boxes I like Google Cloud Compute the most, and for businesses already running Office 365 Microsoft Azure makes for the easiest transition.\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

Open ‘Windows Powershell’ or ‘Command Prompt’ with Admin privileges (right click -\u0026gt; Run as Administrator) Let’s check the System Health first, by running these commands:  dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth   I’m sure that will give you an error stating that it could not perform the task. Afterward, Let’s specify the file from the ISO so that we can fix it. Run the following command: (Notice that X must be the drive letter on which your system has mounted the ISO)  DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /source:WIM:X:SourcesInstall.wim:1 /LimitAccess   Now let’s repair any damage in the system files, shall we?  sfc /scannow    Once this is complete, you will see you now have a functional windows environment again. One other tip that I would suggest is to re-run windows updates because your windows components were damaged and the updates have not been happening.\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

However, recently I tried the windows software raid on a home theater PC. We recently had a power issue and caused the RAID 1 to go into resyncing status. Since it was about 2 TB of data, the resync would take several days and be causing performance issues. I found I could not break the raid or remove the mirror.\nThe following solutions are how you’d fix the issue:\nSolution One:  Open up Disk management (Start -\u0026gt; Run -\u0026gt; Type diskmgmt.msc) Right click disk to remove from Raid and select Offline (Click on Disk to left not the graphic on right) Reboot PC Open Disk management back up, select disk, and put online. Immediately after, Right click graphic and select remove Mirror.  Solution Two:  Physically unplug one of the disks Open Disk Management Remove Mirror  In closing, this will get rid of your raid and give you the ability to repurpose these disks as you see fit. In the above experience, I still had my data on both disks so I just formatted one and repurposed it for other functions.\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

Sometimes people lost the disc, re-partitioned their drives, or simply had their hard drive fail. This leads to installing windows from scratch and hunting down all your drivers.\nThat is all changing in Windows 8, they are including a “Refresh” option and a “Remove everything and Re-install Windows” option.\nI’m skeptical on how well this works, but in theory, this could be a great thing for the home user. Windows 8 computers are likely to get infected, just as much as a Windows 7 computer. However, having these options at users fingertips could be a blessing or a curse. Imagine if a virus re-programs these features, wouldn’t that be fun 😉 I guess we will just have to wait and see.\n“Refresh your PC” The Windows refresh PC options remove all user-installed applications from 3rd parties, i.e. Adobe products from a disc, Google Chrome, or anything you installed on the “desktop” portion of windows 8. This pretty much erases all applications on your PC, except those from the windows store. You see where I’m going here, don’t you? Microsoft hopes that end users will purchase EVERYTHING from their store, which it can vet and make sure it doesn’t have viruses. Microsoft will, of course, take a piece of the pie on that purchase and is why Windows 8 will be so cheap. I have mixed emotions on this, but it does make a lot of sense.\n“Remove Everything and Reinstall Windows” This will be nice to have it part of the operating system. It should have been there on past windows, but better late than never. A simple reformats, and reload without the need to hunt down the correct windows disc.\nOverall, I’m happy to see Microsoft taking steps to transition the computer world away from where we have been. There will be bugs, and Windows 8 is a far cry from perfect, but I like its direction. I’m looking forward to the official launch next month.\nTo Learn more about Windows Refresh PC and Restoring custom images go to http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/04/refresh-and-reset-your-pc.aspx\nThis details creating a custom refresh image which would include 3rd party applications. This could be a godsend for IT Professionals in business, since the image would be local and easily a one-click fix all button, so to speak.\nChris Titus Tech Social  Twitter - https://twitter.com/christitustech YouTube - https://youtube.com/c/ChrisTitusTech Twitch - https://twitch.tv/christitustech Odysee / LBRY (Privacy) - https://christitus.com/lbry  Exclusive Content  ChrisTitus.com Members Section (CC Only)  Digital Downloads with Guides and Pre-Built Images Monthly Members Only Video $5 Per Month (100% of Proceeds goes to Chris Titus Tech)   YouTube Chris Titus Tech Membership (All Payments Accepted)  Monthly Members Only Video YouTube Emojis for Comments and Live Chat YouTube Badges that changes based on membership time for comments and chat.

Typically it will take 10-15 minutes before it restarts and up to 30 minutes to start the Microsoft Exchange Information Store. Consequently, what is really happening in the background is the IS service is being terminated incorrectly on shutdown and the store is left in a “DIRTY” shutdown state. This is very bad on several levels and can cause the Store to corrupt and not start at all, which can be catastrophic.\nLuckily, it’s a simple fix and all you have to do is shut down the services before restarting. Below is a script that does it automatically. So, just plug it into a .cmd or .bat file and run.\n@ECHO OFF\rECHO ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO RESTART SERVER??\rpause\rnet stop msexchangeadtopology /y\rnet stop msftesql-exchange /y\rnet stop msexchangeis /y\rnet stop msexchangesa /y\rnet stop iisadmin /y\rECHO DONE STOPING SERVICES REBOOT NOW!\rpause\rI hope this helps you and keeps your server running until you are able to install it on another server.
