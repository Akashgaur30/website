Here is a decent $30 one with lots of reviews. https://amzn.to/3SV0Y0l\nRedo Thermal Paste By default, almost any and every laptop has excessive thermal compound which leads to higher temperatures. Simply removing the excess compound and apply just a drop of \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; thermal paste will drop temps by about 10 Celsius.\nHere is an example of excess factory thermal compound application:\nAdjust Max CPU Frequency Set your CPU governor to the maximum power it can use. I NEVER use a 100% of the CPU and in most instances rarely break above 50% of its total power. Typically, around 2 GHz is perfect for my day-to-day work. When working on battery, I put this down to 25% on a beefy laptop to conserve most of its power. On weaker laptops, you\u0026rsquo;d probably double these numbers. 100% on AC Power and 50% on Battery.\nLinux - cpupower Required Dependencies Install the following packages\ncpupower acpi-support acpid acpi Example Install:\napt-get install acpi-support acpid acpi linux-cpupower cpufrequtils Setting Min/Max Power Example cpupower frequency-set -g powersave -d 0.8G -u 1.2G Check Frequency cpufreq-info Disable Turbo Turbo will draw more power and reduce battery life while increasing CPU temperature.\nRun the following from a root user:\necho 1 \u0026gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo Turn off CPU Cores The more CPU cores that your laptop uses, the power it will draw.

Windows is a tool and has evolved over the years while dominating the PC Market since the 90s. So it begs the question, is it bad?\nWhat it does well There are certain things Windows does better than any other OS. The operating system itself has an amazing assortment of compatibility and gaming.\nIf you want to play the most software and games that works with all your hardware, Windows is your best bet and that isn\u0026rsquo;t changing anytime soon.\nWhy use something else? Let\u0026rsquo;s say you don\u0026rsquo;t mind some software or hardware not working or you want to pick out specific hardware to use on another operating system. What do you gain?\nBetter Security - Windows is know to be easily hackable, from the NSA tool leak in 2017, Ransomware, and out dated kernel design. Windows is an absolute security nightmare. Both Mac and Linux offer proper elevation support with a NIX design, while windows does not and relies on the tacked on UAC system. Better Privacy - Windows has extremely egregious telemetry, but what information does Windows collect? Type Description Hardware information CPU speed, memory capacity, battery, HDD size. Network Data Adapter speed, WiFi Data, and Mobile data if SIM exists Event Metrics Basic pc events State Changes App uptime, CPU allocation to what app, and crashes Accessory data What you have connected to the PC Microsoft Store Logs Purchases, installs, updates, viewed, launched, etc. In-depth system specs Greater detail on hardware capabilities App logs How often you use what and how quick they are Browser activity logs Shows what sites you visit and what you searched for Enhanced Error Reporting Dumps entire memory and submits anything running. Keylogging provided by \u0026ldquo;Improve Inking and typing recognition\u0026rdquo; More Consistency - One of the biggest issues Windows has is the rolling update cycle that tends to mess up computers. There are ways businesses tame this process and I\u0026rsquo;ve even shown how to have sane windows update settings, but the default configuration will typically land users in an undesirable place more often than not. Mac and Linux typically have much better update cycles and far fewer issues with system updates, and need fewer reboots. The Microsoft HATE This all doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound too bad, most people don\u0026rsquo;t care about privacy or security as they freely give it away on social media. See this image if you want a good laugh at how bad people are at these practices.\nSo why do people hate Microsoft and try to get away from Windows? The monopoly and absolute ruthless business model it has built over the past 30 years is something to marvel at.\nGovernment Cooperation It has grown so influential from its massive government lobby and has even an entire wing dedicated to working with governments. While some of this is bad, not all of it is. Their monitoring has helped stop some cyberattacks, like Ukraine cyber attacks in 2022 and this close partnership even had the NSA and FBI remotely hack into Microsoft exchange servers and patch the system. (source: https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2021/04/14/nsa-and-fbi-move-to-help-microsoft-with-its-exchange-server-vulnerabilities/)\nThe downside to this is when the NSA tools leaked in 2017 with blatant backdoors that spawned a massive ransomware attack around the world with EternalBlue exploit that then spawned a host of WannaCry ransomware payloads delivered to millions of computers. (source: https://www.wired.com/story/eternalblue-leaked-nsa-spy-tool-hacked-world/)\nThe Companies Microsoft Killed \u0026ldquo;Embrace, extend, and extinguish\u0026rdquo; (EEE), also known as \u0026ldquo;embrace, extend, and exterminate\u0026rdquo;, is a phrase that the U.S. Department of Justice found that was used internally by Microsoft\u0026hellip; (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish)\nThey have successfully murdered companies and ruined countless lives while stifling innovation to get to where they are. Examples:\nBrowser incompatibilities: Netscape killed off and why we were plagued by the hellscape of Internet Exploader and ActiveX controls for almost a decade before Chrome came along. Office: They purposely held back the API to make other competitors, like WordPerfect, able to succeed when they launched in Windows 98. With no documentation this ensured Microsoft Office had to be purchased and used by the world killing many competitors. They also did this by making Office documents render improperly in other browsers that weren\u0026rsquo;t Internet Explorer. Purposely breaking Java programs on other systems so they weren\u0026rsquo;t cross-platform. They\u0026rsquo;ve settled with Sun for over 2 billion dollars in a lawsuit they lost back in 2002 and 20 million in 2001. Why email sucks? Microsoft implemented MAPI protocol instead of using many common forms like SMTP, POP, or IMAP. On October 1st of 2022, they disabled the following protocols from Exchange Online: Outlook, EWS, RPS, POP, IMAP, and EAS and even SMTP gets disabled if not used. So the hate comes from the world that never happened because of Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s greed. The missed innovations, the companies that were forced to shutdown, and the lives that it destroyed, all to make the Microsoft monopoly.\nWalkthrough Video ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/is-windows-bad/","tags":["Microsoft"],"title":"Is Windows Bad"},{"categories":["Linux","MacOS"],"contents":"This standalone package manager is absolutely stunning and I can\u0026rsquo;t believe I\u0026rsquo;m just now discovering it\u0026rsquo;s true power.\nI was wrong, NIX is the best standalone package manager.\n\u0026mdash; Chris Titus Tech (@christitustech) August 15, 2022 Installation Source: https://github.com/NixOS/nix\ncurl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh Note: I\u0026rsquo;d recommend multi-user install if it prompts for it.\nFinding Packages I\u0026rsquo;d recommend using their website to find packages to install, but make sure to click the \u0026ldquo;unstable\u0026rdquo; button has NixOS stable is a Linux Distribution few use.\nhttps://search.nixos.org/packages\nOr from terminal you can list all packages with nix-env -qaP then just grep what you are looking for.

This is my breakdown of the entire experience and recommendations. This certainly won\u0026rsquo;t be for everyone, but for those that attempt it, I can promise that it will be extremely rewarding for those that have the willpower to do it.\nIts been a week since I first switched to a dumb phone. I\u0026#39;m never going back. Smart phones cost me way to much time! pic.twitter.com/aV4DEYKbM6\n\u0026mdash; Chris Titus Tech (@christitustech) August 11, 2022 Why use a dumb phone? Here are the benefits for using a dumb phone that I have found:\nMore Productivity Mindfulness Less Anxiety More at rest No longer overwhelmed There is probably more, but these are the two massive things that has changed my life for the better. I can boil down these benefits to the fact I can\u0026rsquo;t check my email, look up a restaurant, google some fact, browse social media, and many other apps dinging or grabbing my attention. The greatest strength of the smart phone is it can do ANYTHING, but that can lead to massive decision fatigue and it personally made me FAR less productive.\nMy Journey and Downsides I had no intention of using a dumb phone, but then after researching some privacy, and security phones I bought one that looked cool. Little did I know, the Punkt MP02 really was a dumb phone with an app for Signal, so it could be marketed as a \u0026ldquo;Security Phone\u0026rdquo;.\nMy first reaction was, \u0026ldquo;This phone SUCKS!\u0026rdquo;, but I needed to make a video about it, so I continued. Initially I was in shock without my smart phone:\nNo News when on the toilet Email on the go Music while working out or walking Workout Apps Food Apps Social Media: Twitter to kill time, or YouTube studio to check comments, etc. Within an hour or two I was bored during tasks my smart phone would fill in. Having said that, I really didn\u0026rsquo;t even use my smart phone much. My digital wellbeing app clocked in at an average of 30 minute of usage a day. While many people are using their phones 3+ hours per day. The average in the world being 3 hours 15 minutes screen time per day and Americans spending 4 hours 16 minutes on mobile devices per day!\nAfter I became bored and didn\u0026rsquo;t fill in every second, something magical happened. I actually had a cloud lift from me, and I started doing all the tasks I\u0026rsquo;d been putting off. I did more in that one day then I had in the PAST WEEK!\nRecommendations and Cheating There are some recommendations and \u0026ldquo;cheating\u0026rdquo; I do when it comes to quality of life. But before I get in to that, I have to say, \u0026ldquo;You do not NEED your smartphone\u0026rdquo;. All these things are simply conveniences and if push came to shove, I\u0026rsquo;d rather lose these things than have them because of the benefits of a dumb phone.\nNavigation This is a big one, but on my dumb phone there is WiFi tethering. My workaround is simply to use an all-in-one android car deck I installed last year that utilizes the WiFi.\nUber, Food, Music, Workout and Bank Apps Most of these are covered by using a computer and a webpage, however for those that do require a physical phone I can either use my old smartphone or get away with a android image off of https://www.osboxes.org/android-x86/ and load it up in Virtualbox or VMWare. Here is a walkthrough video I did on that:\nGroup Messages This is one of the downsides, because most dumbphones can\u0026rsquo;t do MMS or groups messages. The Punkt MP02 doesn\u0026rsquo;t do group messages but can receive them independently and GIFs come in, but emoji\u0026rsquo;s do not. Depending on the phone, these things may or may NOT work. One workaround is to use Google Fi for your carrier and then https://messages.google.com\nCamera and Photos Use an actual camera and then upload them your storage. Like we did back in the day!\nWill I Go Back? I sincerely doubt it. If anything I might get a bit better dumb phone with a bit more options like music or even a good camera if that ever became an option. However, my well being is first and foremost and after I STOPPED lying to myself that I needed a smart phone. I haven\u0026rsquo;t felt this good in a very LONG time.\nThere is also a lot of folks that simply addicted and can\u0026rsquo;t quit their smartphone. Even though my usage was 30 minutes a day with minimal usage, I was addicted. They are designed that way. I was lying to myself when I said I\u0026rsquo;ll just delete my social media apps or this or that. In the end, when boredom hit, I always would pick up my phone because there was always SOMETHING it could do to fill the time.\nIn the end, most of the population simply can\u0026rsquo;t quit it and will remain addicted and working with it as a severe handicap on their life. This gives me the ultimate edge to get ahead and produce more content than a person with a smart phone.\nWalkthrough Video ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/switching-to-dumbphone/","tags":["Dumbphone"],"title":"Life without a Smart Phone"},{"categories":["Windows"],"contents":"Windows Defender can be a massive drain on system performance and often can have a lot of false positives.

Using sudo can be dangerous and brew installs it to a home directory instead of systemwide without needing sudo. A good example of this.

Thanks to the website RegExr for testing this insane string. pic.twitter.com/FHVonwqcsh\n\u0026mdash; Chris Titus Tech (@christitustech) July 31, 2022 However, for many years I just couldn\u0026rsquo;t be bothered to learn anything beside the basics .* or [a-z]. I just had a project pop up where I\u0026rsquo;d have to spend hours finding and replacing a complex markdown line I was using to pull images and a video link. The solution was painfully obvious\u0026hellip; either I get better with RegEx or spend hours finding and replacing text in hundreds of posts.\nUnderstanding RegEx Learning all the syntax for RegEx is not happening for me and probably many others. There is a solution for this and you don\u0026rsquo;t need to\u0026hellip; https://regexr.com/\nNow that you have an explainer of all the syntax and cheat sheet. We just need to know a few basic features of RegEx, so you can perfect the pattern that you need. Also, the need to understand groups and variables will make the find and replace much more powerful.\nMaking the Perfect Pattern With our test example on regexr.com we can test our pattern to make sure we match exactly what we need. Now normally a guide would start talking about .* and other match characters, but frankly any site like regexr or regex101.com, will have those laid out for you.\nInstead, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about escaping characters and how to match weird expressions that have syntax like [,(,+,? and more. All these can really mess up matching your pattern. So you need to escape the with a \\ before the symbol, so it would look something like this \\[blah\\] this is regex speak for [blah] the escaping character makes it actually register the bracket or parenthesis. Without it, it will probably just give you some syntax error.\nThe websites I gave above are perfect for pointing out flaws in your pattern or maybe you missed escaping that + sign or question mark. It\u0026rsquo;s why having these syntax sites available is vital.\nSelection Groups Now that you understand how to match things with RegEx you can wipe out things with ease, but what about saving that bit of the match you need?\nExample (I want to save youtube video id):\nimg.youtube.com/vi/0q3rGKIMZg Using this Regex will clean it up and save the id using the selection group.\n.*vi\\/(.*) This will match and SELECT everything after vi/ with (.*) in the string, where .*vi\\/ matches img.youtube.com/vi/. The value 0q3rGKIMZg will be stored in $1 which is the first selection group. If you do multiple () selections the second one would be $2 and so on.\nExample new format from old {{ youtube 0q3rGKIMZg }}\nThe replace field would simply be {{ youtube $1 }}\nWalkthrough Video ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/regex/","tags":["RegEx"],"title":"Save HOURS of work with Regex"},{"categories":["Linux"],"contents":"Security is a journey, not a destination\nSo after making a couple videos showing how to increase performance in desktop computers running Linux, I was overwhelmed by the sheer scale of comments worried about mitigations. If you are worried about that, you should be even more worried about the things below.\nHere are the 3 biggest things I see wrong in Linux installs that can easily be exploited or lead to massive problems. I\u0026rsquo;m choosing some of the worst offenders from the basic security layers an attacker goes through.\nNetwork Level - Not using a Firewall Managing a firewall on a system can be a monumental task, but one of the most important is managing the traffic coming to and from your computer. The best packages for this in Linux is ufw and fail2ban.\nUFW Uncomplicated Firewall is easy to setup and understand. It blocks traffic and allows it.\nInstall UFW sudo apt install ufw My recommended Rules sudo ufw limit 22/tcp sudo ufw allow 80/tcp sudo ufw allow 443/tcp sudo ufw default deny incoming sudo ufw default allow outgoing sudo ufw enable Fail2Ban Fail2Ban is one of the best programs that is installed in every single Linux server I have EVER installed. This program is a intrusion prevention utility. Most install it, but forget to configure and use it. These are the settings I like to use.\nInstalling Fail2Ban sudo apt install fail2ban My Fail2Ban Settings File Fail2Ban by default doesn\u0026rsquo;t really do much unless you adjust the settings file. Here is mine, but feel free to change it to your needs.\nAll configuration files are in /etc/fail2ban\nConfiguration file examples and defaults are in two main files /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf and /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf\nMy Config - /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\n[DEFAULT] ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8 ::1 bantime = 3600 findtime = 600 maxretry = 5 [sshd] enabled = true Now in more complex service environments I would generally start adding services and programs like ssh-jail.conf to the /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/ directory. Any program that hackers use is typically always under watch, like WordPress installs for example:\n/etc/fail2ban/jail.d/wordpress.conf\n[wordpress] enabled = true filter = wordpress logpath = /var/log/auth.log maxretry = 3 port = http,https bantime = 300 Enabling Fail2Ban sudo systemctl enable fail2ban sudo systemctl start fail2ban Operating System Level - Adding Repositories Too many times do I see people installing and using 10+ repositories on a Linux install. Obviously, adding repositories to get the programs you want on your system is something you will do. However, there is a hierarchy to these repositories and if you just blindly trust and import all the keys to the repositories, they can and will override packages from the base distribution. This isn\u0026rsquo;t good and can lead to security issues or even break your system. I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend putting a priority on these, so it will only use them when the package doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist in that base repo.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t use any priority, often times the package you want from the added repo is installed and updated, but sometimes they add OTHER packages in that repo that will also overwrite existing packages, which can lead to some undesired results.\nPrioritizing Repositories Official documentation for APT (Debian) - https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/UseThirdParty\nAll priority preference files are stored in the /etc/apt/preferences.d/ directory.\nExample: volian.pref\nPackage: * Pin: origin deb.volian.org Pin-Priority: 100 Set specific packages to only install with the Package: * Line Pin: Origin is the address of the repo Pin-Priority is generally 100 which means it will update packages NOT in base repos. 1 = do not auto update 100 = update if not in other repos over 100 = overwrite base repos Arch doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any priorities in pacman that I can find, but most are building from source with limited 3rd party repositories. Building from source presents even more dangers for those that are blindly installing programs through the AUR.\nApplication Level - Not using AppArmor or SELinux Most Linux distributions have one of these installed by default, but there is one major one that most forget. Arch Linux. A lot of install scripts forget apparmor and SELinux is too complex for many to install. These programs do one massive security feature that many just don\u0026rsquo;t realize. They can sandbox and limit program access even when they get elevated. If an application profile doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, they typically limit its access to the home folder and limit hardware access. You can customize application profiles to expand or limit access as needed. Without having either of the programs installed, you are putting yourself at risk.\nHowever, just the simple act of installing these programs often leads to them being used or setup. They typically are set up to be in complain mode for AppArmor or permissive mode for SELinux. While these are fine for logging and adding some security, it normally would NOT stop the program doing damage.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve set these up in server environments and it is not trivial to do or maintain. Most, if not all, Linux desktops don\u0026rsquo;t bother with setting these to enforce mode and blocking programs that don\u0026rsquo;t comply to their application profile. This requires the end user to have knowledge of how to set up profiles and generate them when they are missing, so the programs will work correctly.\nTo learn more about using them: AppArmor Documentation https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/Documentation SELinux Documentation https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/selinux_users_and_administrators_guide/index\nWalkthrough Video ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/linux-security-mistakes/","tags":["Security"],"title":"The 3 Biggest Security Mistakes Linux Users Make"},{"categories":["Linux","Windows"],"contents":"This goes over reducing the size of a VMDK file using open-vm-tools and is used often in VMWare environments.\nTools Needed I\u0026rsquo;d recommend VMWare Workstation Pro, but you can get away with just using player if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a license.\nInside the Guest (Virtual Machine) you need to install open-vm-tools on Linux which should be in the base repository for most main distributions.\nShrinking VMDK On Guest These are done on the GUEST (Inside Virtual Machine)\nvmware-toolbox-cmd disk shrink / If you are want to shrink a Windows Guest you need to install VMWare-Tools inside the VM.

This is because the core archlinux-keyring is badly out of date and it will show that any package you are trying to install is out of date, corrupt, or having marginal trust.\nObviously changing the repos to official arch ones would fix this, but then that would change the kernel and a variety of other packages. To fix the key signatures the easiest thing is to grab the up to date keyring from the core archlinux repos and manually install it.\nDownload Official archlinux-keyring ZST Package: https://archlinux.org/packages/core/any/archlinux-keyring/download Then install the downloaded ZST file through pacman - Ex. sudo pacman -U archlinux-keyring-20220713-2-any.pkg.tar.zst\nThis solves all your signing issues.\nMaking your own Steam Deck HTPC The new steam interface for steam deck is absolutely a home run.

Without your continued use, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have jobs.\nWhy is Windows NOT secure? Legacy systems and a fundamental flaw in system design. It is far to easy to get system level access through a variety of methods. Let\u0026rsquo;s go over the systems that you can use to exploit a traditional Windows user, so you know what NOT to do.\nPowerShell Powershell is one of the most powerful tools in Windows, but it is at a cost. While it makes it incredibly easy to administrator and make modifications to massive amounts of systems quickly, it can be abused. Pretty much anything you want to do can be accomplished with Powershell. This is most evident in business systems where it is required to administer systems and even Office 365 in the cloud.\nTask Scheduler So many processes end up running at a system level in Task scheduler and something the core system relied heavily on. This can not be disabled and is always one of the biggest Achilles heels for Windows. I am often disabling tasks to debloat systems such as auto-submission tools Microsoft uses like Telemetry and even Defender bug reports.\nVisual Basic - .vbs scripts VBS scripts often provide a level of scripting that isn\u0026rsquo;t possible with many other methods. While this is good in business, it is very bad for the end user. I designed a vbs script to migrate on-premises outlook mailboxes to O365 mailboxes so a thousand users wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to redownload all their emails. However this can easily be abused for those malicious actors out there. Be cautious of this loophole and any vbs script that runs on your system.\nGroup Policy Again this is used in many pro+ systems and even if you aren\u0026rsquo;t part of a domain can be abused by using gpedit.msc to create a local policy that can run scripts, lock user features, and much more. Home users typically don\u0026rsquo;t have this functionally unless a hack is done.\nIf you want Group Polcy as a home user type the following in an elevated to Administrator prompt:\ndism /online /norestart /add-package:\u0026#34;%SystemRoot%servicingPackages{{PackageFileName}}** Registry So many things can be accomplished with the registry, such as auto login, and various hooks that can happen by just launching your web browser or windows explorer. Registry is basically the brain of windows and can be exploited easily to do pretty much anything.\nHow to protect yourself I highly recommend hardening your system with just basic tools that do NOT run in the background, but disable many of the tools above. These tools are wonderful in the right hands, but world ending the wrong ones.\nA simple free hardening tool on Github will disable many of these attack surfaces and do FAR more than any antivirus or internet security suite can, while also not adding ANY overhead or extra processes to your system.\nHardenTools to disable services: https://github.com/securitywithoutborders/hardentools\nWalkthrough Video ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/not-safe-windows/","tags":["Security"],"title":"You are NOT safe in Windows"},{"categories":["Windows"],"contents":"Windows Defender is often seen as a good antivirus, but I want to inform you of a cost noone sees but developers because of Defender.\nIs Windows Defender Good? Yes. It does detect a ton of viruses and have good detection rates as long as you are online, since it relies heavily on its online connection. However, there is a dark side to having Microsoft control this entire part of your PC that we need to go over. The false positives are excessive and I believe it is by design.\nThe Mafia for Software Developers Smartscreen is powered by Windows Defender and you have to buy a $300 A YEAR code signing license with Extended Validation to bypass it. The EV cert is close to the mafia extorting business users for \u0026ldquo;protection\u0026rdquo;. If you don\u0026rsquo;t use Defender, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about smartscreen. Using standard code signing with an external anti-virus will work close to the same as Defender is disabled when you use a 3rd party av.\nCode Signing Cost Cost for 1 year - prices as of 7/11/2022\nSite Extended Validation Regular Validation Comodo$319$85 Instant SSL$299$166 Sectigo$399$179 DigiCert$566$404 The big question is \u0026ldquo;Why does extended validation cost so much more?\u0026rdquo; and it is simply gatekeeping at its best. Many SSL companies will tell you it is because the \u0026ldquo;vetting process is harder\u0026rdquo;, but I smell bullshit on that. It costs usually double and sometimes more. The only difference is it requires a hardware cryptographic key and Microsoft smartscreen immediately gives it a pass on all scans.\nExtended Validation Regular Validation Hardware KeySoftware Key Smartscreen BypassedSmartscreen Error I can\u0026rsquo;t find anything in regards to who is really profiting the most of the Extended Validation code signing and if Microsoft is getting a cut since it is basically the only reason to have one. However, the entire situation is a bit suspect and any development person I know loath the process that Extended Validation is.\nFree Anti-Virus Alternatives Is there something better than windows defender that is free? I\u0026rsquo;d say BitDefender Free offers superior protection.\nThis is a drastic shift in recommendation for me, because I used to say \u0026ldquo;All Free AV is worthless\u0026rdquo;, but now I see this from a different angle. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong most FREE antivirus is glorified advertising for a paid product that essentially does the same thing. After looking at all the free offerings, I\u0026rsquo;d say BitDefender Free is better than using Defender.\nPaid Anti-Virus For those that want good detection rates, better privacy, and low overhead. The antivirus I have recommend has stayed the same for years. I recommend ESET for this because it is a proven antivirus that isn\u0026rsquo;t as intrusive as the others.\nWalkthrough Video ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/bad-windows-defender/","tags":["Windows Defender"],"title":"Why I Hate Windows Defender"},{"categories":["Linux"],"contents":"Choosing a Linux distribution can be difficult, especially if you don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Linux. However, over the past several years I\u0026rsquo;ve tried almost every Distribution that you can choose. There are some that I have not installed, because it was just more of the same.\nTo start with there is a misconception that there is thousands of choices in Linux Distributions. While technically true, there is really only 3 distributions you need to know about for desktop use, but before we get into that you need to know about what makes up a distribution. This is mandatory to understand why there is so many different ones that splinter off of these three.\nWhat is in a Distribution Windows and Mac are called Operating Systems, NOT distributions\u0026hellip; but in Linux this isn\u0026rsquo;t the case. Why? That is because each Linux offering has different options at its core. With Windows and Mac you always get the same bootloader, file manager, etc. and in Linux these can differ drastically from one to the next. So this is what makes up the Linux distribution.\nBootloader This can is usually either GRUB or systemd-boot. This may not mean much to you, but i\u0026rsquo;ll explain the difference. GRUB has been around for ages and can be themed while having a ton of flexibility. It supports UEFI and Legacy, while systemd-boot is pretty much included with every modern linux distribution and only boots via UEFI and has a limited menu system. I highly encourage you that want a themed multi-boot system to check out my Top 5 Bootloader project that auto-installs multiple themes: https://christitus.com/bootloader-themes/\nInit System When your system is initializing on startup it needs to verify all the devices it will use and get the system ready for boot. Almost every Linux system these days use systemd. Systemd is very big and inclusive, but to many is bloated. It does much more than just initializing the system. It has Timers, bootloader, services, and much more. I did a YouTube video explaining everything in systemd if you want to learn more. https://youtu.be/hc7J-zWEty8 There is other options out there for Linux and certain fringe distributions that use them, but if you want other options check out init.d and precursors to systemd. They are much faster and if looking at building an ultimate minimal system this is the route to take.\nDisplay Render To draw graphics on the screen we need a render. There are only two major ones you need to know about. Wayland and Xorg. Wayland is the new kid that should be faster and better, but is lacking features and compatibility. Xorg is the old, wise man that just works, but is starting to show its age. To me, I always choose Xorg because Wayland always runs into problems. Xorg has two features that Wayland is lacking for me right now. It has X11 forwarding for running GUI programs remotely through an SSH connection and using legacy programs for sharing a keyboard/mouse across screens using synergy/barrier. I did a video on this here: https://youtu.be/Fci_ALdEzGc. To many it simply doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, because they both fundamentally do the same thing.\nDisplay Manager This really should be called a Login Manager or user selector, but in Linux the entire ecosystem is run by extremely smart technical people, that just so happen to be terrible at marketing. So the \u0026ldquo;Display Manager\u0026rdquo; comes in many flavors and this is where we start to run into many personal options in Distributions. Personally, I really don\u0026rsquo;t care about this, but there are three main ones that are used and can be configured differently:\nlightdm sddm gdm While there are others, these three pretty much are always chosen for a distribution. SDDM is generally bundled with KDE systems (which we will get into here in a bit), GDM is for GNOME systems, and lightdm (my personal fav) is pretty much a catch all. Desktop Environments Think of Desktop Environments as the tools that make up the control center in an Operating System. Want to change the display resolution, theme, colors, fonts, etc. well all that stuff is in the desktop environment. Now you don\u0026rsquo;t technically need a full blow DE with all this stuff. The main thing you do need is a Window Manager to control where windows are placed. With all that said lets layout the common DEs:\nGNOME KDE XFCE Window Managers and many, many, more. This could be a 100 page manual with all the options, but I want to give you the basics. GNOME gives more of a mac-esque style and KDE gives that windows look and feed. XFCE is more bare-bones with the essential tools and not much else. Where a basic \u0026ldquo;window manager\u0026rdquo; is just the window manager without any utilities. You might think\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;How the hell do you change the resolution? or font? with a window manger\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; This is accomplished either by hard coding it in to the configuration files or by installing an independent utility. Package Managers This is how distributions install programs. Here are the major ones you need to know about.\nAPT - Debian distros apt install programname DNF / YUM - RHEL distros dnf install programname Pacman - Arch distros pacman -S programname Distributions So now that you know what they are made up of we can easily get to deciding what you really want your computing experience to be like. Figure out what components above you like and do NOT like. Then swap them out for something better. The main gripe I have with Windows and Mac is I find their file manager absolutely terrible. I want to switch them and rip out the junk they give me, but we can\u0026rsquo;t as they are integral to the function of the operating system. In Linux, we get that freedom. Here are the three \u0026ldquo;distributions\u0026rdquo; that pretty much everything is based on and what the base package installs are. Remember you can change the things you do NOT like from the stock settings.\nDebian Linux Debian uses a stable release cycle and generally has older packages, but they don\u0026rsquo;t usually have many bugs and are very reliable. This is typically my go to for desktops I don\u0026rsquo;t change much.\nBootloader - GRUB Init System - systemd Display Render - Xorg Display Manager - SDDM/GDM Desktop Environment - KDE/GNOME Package Manager - APT Arch Linux Very new packages with a massive user repository to grab programs you might be missing and builds them for you. The main issue is if you forget to update your system for a period of months it is prone to breaking. Backups are MANDATORY if you use this for your daily use. The benefits are you get the latest and greatest and is often thought to be the best for drivers and hardware that is just released. Its unique that you get to choose every component and can utilize pretty much any COMBINATION of components listed above. The only constant is its package manager which is PACMAN. The other unique aspect is it has a helper program that can install things through the AUR (Arch User Repository) and boy does it have options here\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m going to recommend the top three\nparu yay trizen They follow the same syntax as pacman except you run them at a user level and they can install pretty much any package. For a complete list visit: https://aur.archlinux.org/ Fedora Linux This is a RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) based distribution. It strikes a balance between newer packages and Linux kernels between Debian and Arch. Its not as new as Arch, but not as old as Debian. It has different SPINS but its main download uses the following:\nBootloader - Systemd Init System - systemd Display Render - Wayland Desktop Environment - GNOME Package Manager - DNF Conclusion So the best distribution is the one that suits your needs and preferences. Instead of the one size fits all approach of Mac and Windows, Linux takes a completely different approach. Learn the above and try out the different options and you will make the perfect system for your needs. You will also understand why all the top 5 distros and other Linux garbage on the internet is worthless. That is because there is no perfect distro, however there is the perfect distro for YOU! It just so happens that it is different for each user and you have the options that no other system on earth give you with Linux.\nWalkthrough Video ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/choose-linux-distro/","tags":["Fedora","Debian","Arch"],"title":"Choosing the Right Linux Distro"},{"categories":["Linux"],"contents":"When Ubuntu came on the scene in 2004, it made desktop Linux viable to many with its ease of use and friendly layout. Instead of constantly improving this and becoming the \u0026ldquo;King of All Distributions\u0026rdquo; it took a very different path. While I still use Ubuntu server with some caveats, I will NOT use Ubuntu Desktop.\nWhat Ubuntu does right Before we roast Ubuntu and its decline, we need to understand why they rose to the top. Not only did they make Linux desktop easy, but they did the same in the server realm as well. They also made highly successful and well designed products for Linux, like the Unity Desktop Environment. They were one of the first to also make it easy for us to use nVidia cards on our systems without much fuss.\nThe things that lead to the decline This is not going to be an exhaustive list, but rather the large things they have done to ensure their downfall and what has caused many to leave Ubuntu to never return.\nSnaps By far the biggest issue with Ubuntu is Snaps. They created a universal package manager that can work on any system. Sounds amazing, right? WRONG! The two biggest issues are simple: Its slow as hell and closed source.\nHow is it slow? Well, it can take upwards of 10-15 seconds to launch Firefox snap, which is a web browser that would normally take MAYBE 1-2 seconds. What the hell Canonical!?! It\u0026rsquo;s obviously not ready, so why are forcing everyone to use snaps? Do they just not like users? Do they think their users are just too stupid to know its this slow?\nClosed Source. This can be summed up to there is only one place to download packages, Canonical. Want to open up a Snap store for a competing distribution? Too bad, its closed source. Is this the worst thing about it? No, but why bother with it when there are better solutions like AppImage and Flatpak which ARE open source?\nSpyware Back in Ubuntu 14 they were submitting search results to Canonical. Then in Ubuntu 16 they introduced a bundled amazon store which they were compensated for. Too many this was just simply spyware on their distribution. A blatant cash grab if you will\u0026hellip; However, to me it screams of desperation. They want or need money and this was the easiest way to accomplish this. Apple and Microsoft does this\u0026hellip; why not Canonical? The answer is surprisingly simple, many users ran from big tech for privacy and why choose Ubuntu when their are so many better distributions.\nLack of commitment The last reason many users have given up on Ubuntu is it just feels like Canonical is padding their balance sheet for an eventual buyout from some biggest tech firm. The days of innovation are over and they have killed so many projects that no one trusts them anymore. It has been eroded away by not listening to the community, doing things not in the best interest of their users, and abandoning many, many projects. Here is the short list:\nUbuntu Touch Unity Desktop Environment Mir Display Manager Ubuntu One (Cloud services) PPA Repos - .DEB Packages being phased out from Software Centre The Future The future of Ubuntu Desktop is pretty bleak. It feels like we are watching it circle the toilet bowl to be forever gone in a few years. I want to give two outcomes\u0026hellip;\nIt continues down this path, forcing everyone to use snaps and fades to irrelevance until the entire desktop offering is discontinued.\nIt cuts it losses with snaps and starts streamlining their distro. Gone are the days of slow boot times and bloated distribution installs. It reverts to what it began as\u0026hellip; a user friendly and easy to user distribution that just works.\nWalkthrough Video ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/ubuntu-decline/","tags":["Ubuntu"],"title":"Ubuntu's Decline"},{"categories":["Windows"],"contents":"To many advanced users, Antivirus IS worthless. That is because it uses system resources and provides more annoyances than benefits. However, for many users it is required as they will not know what is a virus or not.\nHow to Scan The biggest issue with antivirus is some show false positives and others show nothing when it is a virus. So what is the best way to scan?\nhttps://virustotal.com is my recommendation. It will help you determine if that exe or zip file you just downloaded from a shady source is infected. This will do a far better job than an individual antivirus scans, since virustotal is an aggregate and uses antivirus engines for EVERY major antivirus.\nWhat not to do Downloading free antivirus is terrible and typically you will be giving away your privacy as they will be submitting the URLs you visit in many free packages, like Kasperky Cloud Free. Avast and AVG on the other hand you will be inidated with popups and upsells to a bloated internet security suite that does nothing but slow your computer down. I\u0026rsquo;ve also seen people install multiple AntiVirus programs, which just slows down a PC considerably while providing little to no extra protection.\nSo Never do any of these things!\nDownload FREE AntiVirus Install, Buy, or Download ANY Internet Security Suite Installing multiple AntiVirus programs False Positives I\u0026rsquo;ve been giving out an exe file for my Debloat Utility to anyone that pays $5 on cttstore.com to help fund its future development. However, since it is a free and open source project that is a PowerShell script that gets converted to EXE it has caused MANY false positives. The reason is many Antivirus companies are lazy and block EVERY powershell script that is converted to EXE. Microsoft, AVG, Avast, etc. which you can see below.\nPowerShell to EXE Disclaimer VirusTotal Result from PowerShell Script to EXE Obviously with false positives there are times where AntiVirus programs completely miss viruses. How does this happen and how I changed the exe to bypass antivirus programs. There are two methods I\u0026rsquo;ve used to reduce or even completely remove antivirus scans.\nCode Signed EXEs have less false positives Code Signing is the practice of using cryptographic keys to sign EXE files like below. Good antivirus programs will NOT flag my EXE when I used a code signing key. However, if I don\u0026rsquo;t sign the EXE it will flag it as a virus. So, why doesn\u0026rsquo;t everyone use a code signing key? It\u0026rsquo;s expensive. Roughly it is $100 a year for the \u0026ldquo;basic\u0026rdquo; code signing and to bypass Microsoft SmartScreen for \u0026ldquo;enhanced\u0026rdquo; code signing it will set you back almost $275 a year. Feels kinda like extortion, but I can appreciate that I now have a digital signature for my exe so folks know it came from me.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s move on to the easiest way to obscure your exe to bypass Antivirus.\nEncrypted Files can not be scanned for viruses Simply created an encrypted file will bypass any scans. I find the easiest way to do this is using 7-zip with SHA256 encryptioon and a password. This is how I distribute my EXE now so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about antiviruses. So, be EXTREMELY CAREFUL when opening files with passwords, as your antivirus can not scan it. If you do not trust the source you downloaded it\u0026hellip; DO NOT OPEN IT!\nHere is an example of a encrypted file: Recommended AntiVirus If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to spend any money then simply use Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Defender. Its decent with it\u0026rsquo;s cloud protection and is already baked into Windows. Its detection rates are passable and has a small system impact.\nThe biggest factors to look at when considering antivirus is System Impact and History/Detection Rates.\nESET NOD32 Antivirus is the best I\u0026rsquo;ve found. They were one of the original antivirus programs with NOD32\u0026rsquo;s creation in 1987 and ESET being founded by the developers of NOD32 in 1992. The basic antivirus is fast has very little passive performance loss and fantastic detection rates. I recommend just doing the basic NOD32 Antivirus\nWalkthrough Video ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/antivirus-worthless/","tags":["AntiVirus"],"title":"Is Antivirus Worthless?"},{"categories":["Linux","Windows"],"contents":"Renewing website domains, paying for web hosting, and having them expire are all going to be a thing of the past.

You don\u0026rsquo;t have to run your own node, but can that is up to you. Using this add-on will help resolve IPFS addresses much faster even in Gateway only mode.\nEnable IPFS Companion Extension\nhttps://docs.ipfs.io/install/ipfs-companion/ After installing IPFS Companion change the following brave settings under Settings -\u0026gt; IPFS\nEnable IPFS Public Gateway Fallback (Not Required, but recommended) Enable IPFS Companion Enable Blockchain domains - The Unstoppable Domains extension (In the future, this should be baked into many browsers. Brave natively supports .crypto)\nhttps://unstoppabledomains.com/extension Blockchains - Not all created equal The technology powering blockchains are amazing, but most just care about the monetary gain. I\u0026rsquo;m more interested in actually using the blockchain and where all the meta data lives for decentralized web or Web3. So what blockchains have I used for this? Lets review:\nEthereum was one of the original ones that is incredible slow and expensive. I feel like this has turned from a usable blockchain into something only millionaires can use. Maybe this will change in the future, but right now it isn\u0026rsquo;t usable because of the cost to submit transactions. ENS Domains uses ethereum. Polygon is a bridge blockchain that drastically improves upon what ethereum started. Fees are non-existent and is very functional. Transfer times are generally about a minute. This is currently what unstoppable domains uses. Solana is not something I recommend, but is considered the fastest blockchain out there. However, It has crashed multiple times and halted completely. I am also skeptical that is even decentralized with the problems it has had. It is very easy to work on and something to watch. Cardano is probably my favorite out of all these blockchains for the future. It is very decentralized, transactions can be as fast as 20 seconds and up to a couple minutes. Its roadmap is probably the most promising blockchain with future transactions hitting upwards of 10,000+ transactions per second in a decentralized format. Another possible chain that can be used in the future. Buying Websites Forever Currently ens domains requires renewing websites, while unstoppable domains provides them forever. This entire space is exploding, so getting a good name is becoming more and more difficult just like the traditional web. There is a very healthy resale market on Opensea.io that folks are using to squat or resell domains purchased through unstoppable domains. If adoption keeps moving this direction, we will soon see some pretty ridiculous prices on domain names. Buying direct from unstoppable domains ranges from $10 to $100 per domain name, depending on domain ending. Here is discount link for unstoppable if you are interested in picking up a domain: https://unstoppabledomains.pxf.io/MX3zVM\nUploading Static Sites Hosting your website through unstoppable domains is pretty easy, but just know you are limited on size if using their uploader. They have a 20 MB Limit!\nSo for large static sites, simply put them all on a IPFS node local or remote and copy the IPFS hash into unstoppable domains to host ANY size of website.\nI personally build my entire static site using hugo because its free / open source. You can then simply upload to IPFS the entire /public folder once you do this. If you are going to go this route, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend hosting an IPFS node so you can avoid the upload process entirely!\nRedirect to Traditional Website The simplist way to do this is with a meta redirect using a standard index.html (PLAIN TEXT ONLY!)\nindex.html\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;HTML Meta Tag\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta http-equiv = \u0026#34;refresh\u0026#34; content = \u0026#34;1; url = YOUR WEBSITE URL HERE\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;YOUR WEBSITE DESCRIPTION HERE \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Walkthrough Video ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/future-internet/","tags":["Websites"],"title":"Future Internet"},{"categories":["Windows"],"contents":"This is a tool that has evolved over several years and achieves much more than just debloating a Windows install. I have expanded it to install the programs you select, which is a bigger selection than ninite. The classic debloat is there, but also includes a tweaks section with quality of life features. To round out everything, I have included my recommended settings for Windows update that I use in a variety of businesses. Misuse of this utility can break your install so please be careful and I do not provide any help or assistance should this happen!\nOne Command - Download and Usage From an Elevated (Run as Administrator) PowerShell prompt\niwr -useb https://christitus.com/win | iex Parts of Utility There are four main parts of this utility but I can expand this to an infinite number of tabs if expansion is needed and will probably happen in the future. As of the writing of this article there is 4 main parts: install, debloat, features and old panels, and windows updates. Let me breakdown what each part does and what you should use.\nInstall The install is basically a better version of ninite that many people use. It leverages Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s winget utility to not only install tons of software that you select with a check-mark, but also gives you the ability to upgrade all the software quickly. By using this utility you will save hours on the install, but also make it very easy to keep all your programs up to date.\nDebloat Debloating windows is always a moving target and there are many utilities out there. Many of them are too heavy handed in my opinion. This takes a more minimal approach that should not damage your Windows install. At the top there are three buttons Desktop, Laptop, and Minimal. These are curated selections based on my recommendations\nDesktop - This is for Desktops DUH, but it will disable features like power throttling and many services will be set to not auto start. This will give your desktop the best performance without any downside.\nLaptop - This one is just like desktop but doesn\u0026rsquo;t mess with power settings as we don\u0026rsquo;t want to kill our laptops battery.\nMinimal - This one will just do the absolute basic privacy / security settings. Very minor optimizations will also be made.\nI must warn you to NOT use all the settings at once, or simple remove everything from the MS Store. Many times this will debloat the install but will BREAK the MS Store or uninstall any games / apps that were installed using it. This is why this option is never selected, but I left it there for those that really want to remove it. I personally do NOT recommend this, but I understand those that want to remove it\nNote: This part of the utility can break an install if used carelessly, but it does make a restore point so if you have a lot problems with it, you can use System Restore to rollback the changes or the Undo All option. THIS IS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDE WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY AND I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MISUSE.\nFeatures and Legacy Win Panels This tab makes it easier to enable built-in features that are off by default. Many new installs need these and I wanted to make it easier than going through and manually installing them one by one.\nThere is also the old school legacy panels that I use on a daily basis. I still find these to be more efficient than the new panels that Microsoft has put in Windows 10 and 11.\nWindows Updates Windows updates set to defaults are crazy. They install and download at weird times and often update far too much. I give 2 options my recommended one that only installs security updates and allowing features updates after they have been proven over 1 year.\nHowever, there is a disable all button. I do NOT recommend doing this, but is there for people that have specific software that they don\u0026rsquo;t update and don\u0026rsquo;t want their windows install changing at all. This is NOT secure, but often more stable and why you\u0026rsquo;d want to do something like this.\nWalkthrough Video ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/windows-tool/","tags":["Debloat Windows","ninite"],"title":"The Ultimate Windows Utility"},{"categories":["Linux"],"contents":"Are you tired of having to reset all your app settings on a new install? Using a simple tool you will never have to reconfig your app settings again. Also adding new apps and programs are extremely simple and intuitive. Stop wasting your time and start using Chezmoi to restore your app settings. This isn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be a system backup but a settings backup.\nWhy Chezmoi Chezmoi offers the most simplistic approach and versioning that is simply is my preferred solution over the other dot file tools below. Here is a brief diagram of how it works. Note: I do not use git from command line in my tutorial for commits and pushes\nNotes about other dot file tools GNU/Stow is a very popular one, but I don\u0026rsquo;t like using it because of its reliance on Symlinks Bare GIT repos are also another way of doing this, but managing the files can be cumbersome Git / Ansible playbooks a great way to deploy new systems, but can be complex to maintain and keep up to date. Home Directory Backups many times end up backing up too much and overly bloat a new system or add in unwanted settings Installation First we install Chezmoi to the /bin folder. I recommend system wide below but you can also do the install to ~/.local/bin if you only want to install for current user\nSystem-wide install /bin Recommended\nsu cd / sh -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsLS chezmoi.io/get)\u0026#34; exit User install ~/.local/bin\ncd ~/.local sh -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsLS chezmoi.io/get)\u0026#34; Note: Most systems have ~/.local/bin, however a few do not\nSetting up config repository First Setup a new repository for your config files on GitHub\nI called mine \u0026ldquo;dotfiles\u0026rdquo; https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/dotfiles\nWe now simply initialize chezmoi with that new GitHub repository\nchezmoi init https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/dotfiles Adding files and Applying changes chezmoi uses a git based aliases to add files and merge them. To add something to your dotconfigs you\u0026rsquo;d simply do this command as an example: chezmoi add .bashrc\nThis copies the file to the working directory ~/.local/share/chezmoi and allows it to be a part of your repository. Just like the name suggests, the working directory is where you should be doing all your edits once they are added.\nOnce you edit your file you need to \u0026ldquo;apply\u0026rdquo; it back to its home so they are used with chezmoi apply\nWhat happens if you edit the \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; file in the home directory? simply merge that change with the working directory with chezmoi merge filename\nNow you are done for the day and you want to submit the changes to the remote repo so you can apply these changes to your other computers. You simply change directory to chezmoi with chezmoi cd or cd ~/.local/share/chezmoi and git add files -\u0026gt; git commit -m \u0026quot;initial commit\u0026quot; -\u0026gt; git push in the command line. However, I really like the desktop application GitHub desktop and prefer to add the ~/.local/share/chezmoi directory to it and do the add, commit, and push in that GUI GitHub Directory shown below.\n","permalink":"https://christitus.com/chezmoi/","tags":["chezmoi"],"title":"Easily moving Linux installs"},{"categories":["Linux","Windows","MacOS"],"contents":"Notes are vital to our productivity but often people either take too many notes or none at all.

I don\u0026rsquo;t use Chrome Browser and I don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy using Andorid apps. This is how I used ChromeOS like a desktop instead of a mobile phone. No, I didn\u0026rsquo;t enable developer mode for this.\nChromeOS Changes to Supercharge the Install The biggest thing about ChromeOS that it has a huge amount of Pros, but is missing some things out of the box that many desktop users need. I changed the browser, photo editing software, gaming, game streaming, and many other tools using ChromeOS\u0026rsquo;s built in Linux environment. The container system (crostini) is absolutely amazing and I was able to utilize all these Linux/Windows tools on my system.\nLaunch Settings and type in search Linux\nSetting up the Linux Environment By default setting up a Linux environment in Chrome is as easy as checking a box in Settings. We just need to modify the environment ChromeOS gives us.\nThen we change the stock repositories in the linux environment so that we can easily install our programs. All the below commands are done in Terminal \u0026ndash;\nInstall Text Editor\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install nano Edit the download repos so we can install more\nsudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list Edit the file to look like this:\ndeb https://deb.debian.org/debian sid main contrib non-free Save and Exit\nUpdate system and install any packages\nsudo apt update sudo apt install packagename Rename package name to be the package you need. Ex. sudo apt install gimp\nWith the environment now setup, we can get a ton of packages into our ChromeOS that automatically add to the start menu. We can add more than this by installing deb packages, adding repositories, or building programs from source using the linux tar.gz files. The sky is the limit!\nInstall Your desktop programs Getting the browser you use on your desktop is the first thing I do. Chrome is great, but not everyone uses it and I prefer Brave a bit more, where others prefer Firefox. You can simple follow the linux install instructions for your browser of choice. Here is some basic ways to install the browser from the Linux Terminal.\nFirefox sudo apt install firefox Brave sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg echo \u0026#34;deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg arch=amd64] https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/ stable main\u0026#34;|sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-browser-release.list sudo apt update sudo apt install brave-browser The remaining programs can be installed using any Linux guide that is based around \u0026ldquo;Debian\u0026rdquo; and most can simple be installed using sudo apt install command. There were a couple programs I installed by download the .deb file. which can be installed using sudo dpkg -i packagename.deb\nPros and Cons of Using ChromeOS Pros More than a web browser Installing other browsers and programs Brave GIMP Linux Programs Performance - Good, but video can be laggy. Perfect for old or low powered equipment Amazing power management Cons No Windows Apps 3d/Video acceleration is crap Everything is Google GApps - Sheets, Word, Etc. Google Drive Google Account is a must Files and System navigation is lacking - USB Drives and recognition issues with external media Installing on an Old Machine Google Extension and 8GB+ Thumbdrive Install via Google Extension (Required) https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm Conclusion ChromeOS has some amazing use cases, but is definitely not for everyone.

Robocopy is a build in command line program that is fantastic at copying files quickly and bypasses many of the downsides of the standard copy process of windows.\nThe downsides of Window\u0026rsquo;s standard file copy are:\nHas to read ALL files being copied BEFORE it will copy the first file Artificial character limit of 255 that includes the filename and filepath.

Example /MT:4 - Use 4 threads to copy files. If no threads set, it will default to 8. /MIR - Mirror Source to Destination - WARNING: WILL DELETE ANY FILES THAT DO NOT MATCH IN DESTINATION! /MOVE - Moves from Source to Destination - WARNING: WILL DELETE ALL FILES FROM SOURCE AFTER COPY! /LFSM:100M - Operate in Low Free Space Mode with 100 Megabytes. 10M = 10 Megabytes 1G = 1 Gigabyte /B - Backup Mode - Great for system backups if you are part of Administrator or Backup Users group - NOT RECOMMENDED - Use 3rd party backup software /ZB - Restartable Backup Mode - Tries to copy files with restartable and if it fails it restarts in backup mode - NOT RECOMMENDED - Use 3rd party backup software /RH:1700-0900 - Scheduled run between 5PM and 9AM and will pause if it is during \u0026ldquo;business hours of 9AM-5PM\u0026rdquo; /LOG+:C:\\robocopy.log - Outputs everything to C:\\robocopy.log (Note: if NOT running as admin you need to put this in your user folder C:\\Users\\username\\robocopy.log) the + adds to the file. /TEE - If using LOG and you also want console output, put the /TEE option in.

Thank you Nik for sharing! It felt only right to share his thoughtful email with a lot of explanations that are hard to find on the net.\nlaunchd Launchd is Darwin/MacOS’s init system. The init portion of systemd is heavily modeled after launchd, but unlike systemd, launchd isn’t a monolithic system manager but only an init system. It\u0026rsquo;s a relatively simple design that follows the unix philosophy. Any further functionality is implemented by daemons that can be disabled with a launchd override plist.\nFor info how to use launchd, check the man pages and read this document from the documentation archive: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/Introduction.html\nYou might also want to take a look at the launchd source code for a deeper understanding.\nI use Xcode’s graphical plist editor to configure daemons because I find it less annoying than editing XML with vim, but there are also light weight plist editors that don\u0026rsquo;t require you to start big ol Xcode every time you want to change something in a daemon.\nJob scheduling can be done either with launchd\u0026rsquo;s native tools or with cron.\nXNU XNU is Darwin’s kernel. It has a fascinating design and I highly recommend reading the source code. It’s a hybrid kernel that uses the Mach microkernel as its foundation and adds a BSD layer derived from FreeBSD and NetBSD on top to provide UNIX functionality. They are slowly turning XNU into more of a microkernel by moving drivers into the userland.\nThe nvram utility can set bootflags. I generally run all my systems with verbose boot, and on some, I also tweak Mach scheduling. I also run a special bootflag on my (jailbroken) iPhone to keep kernel memory usage down so I can assign more memory to my phone’s needlessly complex launchd setup. You can find lists of bootflags with google, but might have to read kernel source code for the more obscure ones.\nKernel sources for macOS 11 have not been released yet, so I assume it is currently not possible to compile a custom kernel for the M1 due to lack of drivers, but I haven’t tried it. The documentation archive contains a detailed overview of the kernel, but some of the information is outdated by now: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/About/About.html\nSmart Folders You can save Finder searches as a so called smart folder, where the found files will be symlinked into the folder. This is useful for a lot of things, such as symlinking all files of a certain file format to the same folder, so you can have a Photos folder that will contain symlinks of all .png files on the system. The symlinks refresh automatically, so when ever you add a new .png somewhere to the filesystem, it would get symlinked to this folder.\nAutomator and Folder Actions You can create custom automation routines with automator. Automator also supports a variety of shell scripting languages such as Python or Bash. Automator actions can be used in a number of ways, such as an icon in your dock that runs the action on any file you drag onto it, or as a right click menu entry, or as a folder action. Folder actions bind automator scripts to folders and execute them on any file you put in the folder. You can for example combine the Bash support of Automator with ImageMagick or FFMPEG to automatically add watermarks to any photo or video you save to a specific folder.\nAutomator also supports AppleScript, which is kind of a weird and arcane language, but offers many UI automization capabilities, that I frequently bind to voice commands for disability accommodation. It also integrates voiceover\u0026rsquo;s text-to-speech which I find incredibly useful to build notification systems for blind people. AppleScript functions can be called from Bash, so I usually just use Bash scripts and access AppleScript when I need it.\nThere is also a paid third party automization tool called Keyboard Maestro, that is supposedly better than Automator, but I don’t have any experience with it.\nPackage Management Pkgutil is Darwin’s native package manager. It does not support dependency resolution, and requires manual package removal, so it should only be used for things that you don’t want to uninstall like custom kernel extensions or patches. Darwin comes with the pkgbuild utility to create installable .pkg files from a root file structure, and can even build a customizable gui installer for them.\nMy package management workflow is as follows:\nI use macports (an implementation of the BSD Ports System) for applications that have too many dependencies to build them manually.\nI use xbps (from void linux) to build and manage packages of unix utilities that I want to use across multiple systems. This is the one I use most. I used to use pacman, but xbps integrates git nicely, so I can just run a git server as my personal binary package repo, and pacman was too much of a headache to compile for mac, frankly. I will probably eventually transition to using macports for custom packages too, but xbps just makes it incredibly easy to build packages, and I’m already experienced with it because of void linux.\nI use pkgutil to build packages for kexts, launchd daemons and system tweaks that I want to use across multiple systems.\nI use a program’s included makefile for utilities that I only want to use on the system that I’m compiling them on.\nI’ve been considering building a custom binary package manager with Swift and plists to replace this workflow, but I don’t know if I’m actually gonna do that.\nDirectory Structure The system partition is mounted as read-only in more recent versions of macOS, but if you want to tweak lower level stuff, you can either temporarily mount the partition with write privs with the standard mount command while in recovery mode, or run ‘csrutil disable’ in the recovery mode terminal to disable read-only mounting entirely. But make sure you keep timeshift backups around if you’re gonna mess with the system partition. I do not recommend that you ‘debloat’ macOS, and instead use launchd overrides to disable things like Find My Mac. Deleted system apps will just be reinstalled during updates, and they aren’t wasting resources while they aren’t loaded, so you don’t have much to gain except a few more megabytes of ssd space.\nEnable hidden files with command + shift + . and explore the file structure.\nUser-installed unix utilities belong in /usr/local/bin.\n/usr/bin contains the default tools. FreeBSD’s cpuctl is included and works with the M1. This can be useful to disable all CPU cores except one of the power saving cores, as a custom ultra-low power mode on MacBooks, but there is also a boot flag to disable CPU cores. Another useful one is firmwarepasswd to password lock the bootloader. I use that + full drive encryption on devices that I take through airports. You might also want to check out diskutil and its manpage for command line partition management.\n/Applications contains your gui apps. You can drag this folder into your dock to get a much better grid view than launchpad, or right click on it to change it to a list view, which gives you something like the Windows 98 start menu. Applications are folders that you can explore by right clicking on them in finder or with the cd command. Applications don’t need to be in the /Applications directory to be run, so you can put them on an external drive. They will not show up in launchpad or the applications list in your dock if you place them somewhere else, but you can just symlink them from an external drive to /Applications. Spotlight will still be able to find apps even if they aren’t symlinked to /Applications. The Mac version of QuickTime is pretty great btw. The windows version has nothing in common with it except the name, so give it a chance if you were put off by your experience with it on windows.\n/Library contains settings plists and libraries. A lot can be customized here so I recommend digging around. There is also a Library folder in /System for deeper configuration, and one in your home directory for user-specific tweaks.\nWindow Management I only ever use splitview for a terminal + safari combo, so I don\u0026rsquo;t mind that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer more complex tiling functionality, but there are a number of tiling window management plugins such as Yabai, amethyst or chunkwm. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any experience with those because I was a CWM user on the *BSDs.\nIf you have a mouse with thumb buttons, I highly recommend going into System Preferences -\u0026gt; Mission Control and binding Mission Control to Mouse 4 and Application Windows to Mouse 5. All non-mini macs ship with either a touch pad or a mouse that has a touch surface, so where you would use gestures to control window management, but since you don\u0026rsquo;t have that, it would be good to bind it to buttons instead. Mouse 5 will show you all windows of the currently active application, and mouse 4 will show you all windows and virtual desktops. You can also set up hot corners to emulate Gnome and KDE\u0026rsquo;s window management.\nSafari Adblocking I need to use Safari because it\u0026rsquo;s the only browser with proper screen reader support. I like it over all for its performance, memory and battery efficiency, but an annoying issue is that there are no good adblockers for it because it restricts the level of access that extensions have to your traffic. AdGuard (not on the App Store) is a pretty decent alternative that works not only on MacOS but also Android and iOS and blocks ads systemwide, but a pihole would work too. I also run Little Snitch (also not on the App Store) for traffic monitoring.\n","permalink":"https://christitus.com/macos-sysadmin-tips/","tags":["sysadmin"],"title":"Macos Sysadmin Tips"},{"categories":["Linux","Windows","macOS"],"contents":"Looking for a Tech Gift this holiday season?

They are wildly volatile speculative assets that\u0026rsquo;s valuation will swing wildly from one moment to the next. However, This article isn\u0026rsquo;t about how much its worth or how much it will be worth. This is about it\u0026rsquo;s practical application and how it will change the world we live in. Just by having this knowledge you will be able to profit and be ready for that future.\nPractical application of crypto is all over our society today. Many banks are using it, and wealthy individuals are utilizing it. Here are the ways it is used today:\nInternational Bank transfers (Ripple) - Long wire delays and intermediary banking is becoming a relic of the past. Banks can leverage it to make trustless transfers between banks in seconds around the world. International Money Transfers (Bitcoin) - Want to send money to a relative in a different nation? Well using Bitcoin is probably the easiest way to get this done with almost no fees. You could send $1000 for less than $1 fee. Banking Replacement (Yield Farming) - Some companies are providing loans and holding crypto while passing along a profits to those holding crypto with them. Think of a savings account on steroids or collateral loans. Synthetic Assets (Synthetix) - What to trade Apple stock, gold, or other assets that exist? Sythetic assets are tracked using the blockchain and traded either for the said asset or for the dollar amount the asset is worth. Send Private Transactions (Monero) - Send money between two entities completely that is completely private. Please note: Bitcoin and other projects are actively tracked, while some are still privacy oriented, much like physical cash. Insurance, Data Backup, and all kinds of data that you will always want a ledger of. How to Store Crypto There are two ways of thinking about storing crypto. You can either hold it all yourself or you can use a custodian where you rely on a company to hold it for you, much like a bank. Let\u0026rsquo;s address both ways:\nStoring Crypto in Your Wallet There are digital wallets where you can safely store your crypto and access it. They come in two types with different pros and cons.\nHot Wallets Hot wallets refer to software that runs on your computer with a password that protects the crypto.\nPros:\nConvenient Quick Access Fast exchanges Cons:\nSecurity: Computer compromised or Private key theft Backups: If you lose your password or misplace your keys/seed\u0026hellip; there is no recovery. Recommended Wallets:\n(Desktop \u0026amp; Mobile) Exodus https://www.exodus.io Other advanced wallets I\u0026rsquo;d recommend come from the official projects or opensource on github.com Cold Wallets Cold wallets refer to hardware that hides the keys so the computer never sees them, but you authorize transactions on the device itself.\nPros:\nSecure Transfers take place on isolated device Cons:\nNot as Quick If you misplace your device, you can only recover things through a seed (phrase written on paper) Backups: If you misplace both the seed and device\u0026hellip; everything is gone Recommended Wallets:\nLedger https://www.ledger.com Trezor https://trezor.io Storing Crypto with a Custodian These are companies that you are sending your money to for safe keeping, much like a bank. They can be insured, but none of them are federally insured like a traditional bank account. I lump these companies into three categories, on and off ramps, exchanges, and yield farmers. Here are my take and recommendations on each of these. Note: I like to use companies in my local country for regulatory reasons and safety\nOn and Off Ramp Companies Companies like Coinbase or Gemini are the two I use often. These companies are based in the United States and you can link your bank account to them to transfer Crypto to Dollar directly into your checking account. The fees are high and they should only be used for the purpose. While they do offer other services, it will be at a premium. Please Note: DO NOT use credit cards to purchase crypto! You will have exorbitant fees and it is NOT worth it!\nI don\u0026rsquo;t recommend storing money here, but they do have a good track record. If you only want to hold crypto and do nothing with it, then it is relatively safe with these institutions.\nCoinbase Referral Link: https://christitus.com/coinbase Gemini Referral Link: https://christitus.com/gemini\nExchanges These companies are all over the place. The two I like the most are Bittrex(US) and Binance(Japan). They are the juggernauts in the space and when making crypto to crypto transfers they have the most options with the lowest fees. Many exchanges have been hacked over the years, so I don\u0026rsquo;t store any money here, but use it to exchange crypto. A good example is using Bittrex to transfer LBC tokens to ETH or BTC.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to use a company to exchange crypto, as you can use a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, but the fees are typically more. However, the convenience of not having to register with a form of ID is nice. Other exchange services like Uniswap exist but are centralized, examples are Simpleswap and Shapeshift, but they are starting to require ID (KYC Compliance) as well.\nTLDR: Don\u0026rsquo;t store money here, but use it to exchange out one currency for another\nBittrex Referral Code: 4KR-KYJ-BQG\nYield Companies 2022 Update: Do NOT use them. Celsius, Voyager Digital, and many others have proven that this method is not only extremely risky, but possibly fraudulent. Be skeptical on any companies that is promising returns by holding assets with them in crypto.\nMining Crypto Using a Graphics Card With the DeFi explosion and transaction fees going sky high we can make a profile with a good graphics card. Ethereum will be transitioning to Proof of Stake which means mining it with a graphics card will not be feasible sometime in 2021. However, until that time if interest stay the same or increases, mining will be profitable. Here is how I recommend mining during this time with just a single or small graphics card setup.\nProfitability:\nCheck https://ethgasstation.info and if standard GWEI fee is over 100 then chances are you will be profitable Check https://whattomine.com and see current daily payouts based on your graphics cards Again\u0026hellip; Do NOT buy tons of equipment. This will dry up in the next year and will NOT make money Basic Mining Process:\nSetup a Wallet using Exodus.io Setup an account with Mining Pool Hub Use a LTC Wallet Address from Exodus and Setup Auto-Exchange to Litecoin in Mining pool hub Install PhoenixMiner 5.1c - Forum Post Use the string for PhoenixMiner @ https://ethereum.miningpoolhub.com LTC will be autoexchange and withdrawn to your Exodus Wallet Note: Make sure to setup the Auto Withdrawl feature when setting up AutoExchange\nNote 2: Litecoin is used for minimal fees and fast transactions I highly recommend https://minerstat.com for using a dedicated machine for mining. This will ensure maximum uptime and reliability.\n","permalink":"https://christitus.com/crypto/","tags":["Cryptocurrency"],"title":"Everything You Need to Know About Crypto"},{"categories":["Linux"],"contents":"Setting Up SSH Authentication with GitHub for Secure Access with 2FA GitHub Accounts\nCreating SSH Keys Type this in to create GitHub Keys for your computer\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \u0026#34;your_email@example.com\u0026#34; Notes:\nI typically save this in ~/.ssh/github You don\u0026rsquo;t have to put a password if you aren\u0026rsquo;t worried about security Adding the New Key to GitHub and Local SSH-Agent Type the following on the local machine to add your key to the agent.\neval \u0026#34;$(ssh-agent -s)\u0026#34; ssh-add ~/.ssh/github Copy the contents of ~/.ssh/github.pub to the new key field in GitHub.

Secure-Linux Project https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/secure-linux/blob/master/secure.sh\nBefore running this script install ufw and fail2ban packages\nThis script is broken into 3 parts: ufw, sysctl.conf modifications, and fail2ban. Ufw stands for Uncomplicated Firewall and is fantastic for adding to every install. This script opens http and https, while limiting SSH to only a couple connections per second. The sysctl modifications helps harden your system by preventing spoofing and man in the middle attacks. Fail2ban is the final piece and possibly my favorite. This package see any traffic that is failing authentication attempts repeatedly or is malicious in nature (DDoS) and records the IP then blocks it for a period of time.\nOther things I\u0026rsquo;d recommend not mentioned\u0026hellip; SELinux! Look it up because it is amazing. You can also use this on debian if you\u0026rsquo;d like, but a smaller package called AppArmor is generally used on those types of distributions.\nConclusion This is not a all inclusive guide on securing your Linux system, but it is a good starting point that I do on pretty much every computer.

This is a modular laptop for the raspberry pi that is simply amazing and showcases all that you can do with the pi.\nUsing Elecrow CrowPi Image The Custom Raspbian Linux that CrowPi uses is from https://www.elecrow.com/download/crowpi/. You can load this on any raspberry pi if you just want to use the digital portions to teach. It has a wonderful interface for learning Python and Scratch with code directly operating portions of the CrowPi2. This image also includes Minecraft Pi lessons which is fantastic for teaching and learning for younger students.\nProgramming Lessons The interface for learning both Python and Scratch operate portions of the CrowPi such as making a sound or turning on one of the LEDs. While you can load the CrowPi 2 image on regular pi\u0026rsquo;s without the laptop a lot of lessons would not be meaningful. That said the Minecraft section was fantastic no matter if you were using the CrowPi or not.\nOther interfaces such as Arduino or Microbit do require that component which isn\u0026rsquo;t included. Since both these products can operating pretty much anything you can think up in the real world, it makes sense that you\u0026rsquo;d want to purchase these parts separately as they will vary widely from project to project. I mentioned in my YouTube I wanted to do automated door locks in a future project which I\u0026rsquo;d use Arduino parts to accomplish.\nAs far as starting to learn and understand python, I thought this wasn\u0026rsquo;t the best starting spot. If you or your student has never touched or seen python, I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend intro lessons from https://codecombat.com/ which are free and a great way to get your feet wet with Python before trying something like CrowPi 2 Python lessons.\nRetro Gaming The retro gaming aspect is something that is very familiar to the pi. I went ahead and did a custom RetroPie install only compiling SNES with Emulation Station and put that directly on the crow pi. If I were going to play a LOT of games on this, I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend using a dedicated SD card for Retro pi so you can get maximum performance as running the crow pi desktop and applications along with the emulators will take away from some of the performance when emulating newer hardware like N64 / PS1 games. However, If you are just doing old school games like NES and SNES you won\u0026rsquo;t need to. The one thing I noticed was that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t already integrated and if you aren\u0026rsquo;t already familiar with RetroPi this can be a challenging thing to add if you don\u0026rsquo;t know Linux.\nLearn more about RetroPie here: https://retropie.org.uk/\nOverall Impressions I love this laptop and am looking forward to making some lesson plans for the upcoming school year to teach my kids about it.

I also added Chocolatey package manager to the script for easy program installations.\nThe script will remove scheduled tasks, windows applications, install common applications (adobe reader, notepad++, java, and more), while also disabling services, and removing windows components like Cortana that are performance hogs.\nWhat this script does Main Programs and Tweaks Installs Chocolatey (Package Manager for Windows) Installs O\u0026amp;O Shutup 10 and Runs Recommended Settings Misc 3rd Party program installs (Adobe, 7-Zip, Notepad++, and Media Player Classic-HC) Removals all Bloatware in MS Store (Leaves Office, Snip Tool, Xbox and other Apps used for Gaming) Privacy Tweaks Disabled Services and Tasks\nTelemetry Wifi Sense Smart Screen and Web Search App Suggestions and Activity History Location Tracking and Maps Feedback and Tailored Experiences Error Reporting Cortana Advertising ID.

This removes the Action Center, LockScreen, Sticky Keys, Task View, Expands File Transfer details by default, Show all tray icons, and various other tweaks.\nApplication Tweaks This script will keep the core of Microsoft Office, but most other Microsoft products that are sideloaded are removed. OneDrive is a big one that some use, so if you want that functionality check the customization section. Most other features removed aren\u0026rsquo;t used, like Internet Explorer and Work Folders.\nCustomization I encourage people to fork this project and comment out things they don\u0026rsquo;t like! Here are a list of normal things people change:\nUninstalling OneDrive (This is on in my script) Installing Adobe, Chocolatey, Notepad++, MPC-HC, and 7-Zip Comment any thing you don\u0026rsquo;t want out\u0026hellip; Example:\n########## NOTE THE # SIGNS!

Here is an example.\n/usr/local/bin/wallpaper-reddit --save /usr/local/bin/wallpaper-reddit --startup --save option flag will save the current wallpaper to the default directory in the config file (~/Pictures/Wallpapers/). Remove this line if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to save past wallpapers. --startup option flag will wait til internet access is established and then download the wallpaper from reddit\nWallpaper-reddit Config File Settings The config file is in ~/.config/wallpaper-reddit, and will be created automatically. Currently, the GNOME, XFCE, MATE, Unity, and Cinnamon Desktop Environments should be automatically detected and the program should set the wallpaper without any extra work. However, due to the varying nature of window managers, it is possible, even likely, that you may have to specify a custom command to set your wallpaper. The program will prompt you for this if this is the case; the exact command can be researched per desktop environment. If your desktop environment is not supported, leave the set command blank and it will auto download to the ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/ directory as wallpaper.jpg for the daily wallpaper.\nConfig Options minwidth and minheight set the minimum dimensions the program will consider a valid candidate for a wallpaper. If --resize is enabled, the script will resize the image to those dimensions before setting the wallpaper. minratio is the minimal aspect ratio of the image. It is a float value of width/height of the image, for example 1.6 for 16:9 image. maxlinks is the maximum number of links the script will go through before giving up. resize does the same thing as the --resize flag. It is enabled by default. random does the same thing as the --random flag.\nRecommended Wallpaper Subreddits EarthPorn CityPorn SkyPorn WeatherPorn BotanicalPorn LakePorn VillagePorn BeachPorn WaterPorn SpacePorn multiwall wallpapers wallpaper ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/change-wallpaper/","tags":["wallpaper"],"title":"Change your Desktop Wallpaper"},{"categories":["macOS"],"contents":"This goes over how to install macOS on pretty much any piece of hardware.\nOpenCore is a relatively young project, but is by far my favorite. It teaches you the proper way to setup your system to work long term in the macOS ecosystem.\nOpenCore Wiki Source for the content in this post is from https://dortania.github.io/.\nThis knowledge base is fantastic for any information I glaze over or troubleshooting that isn\u0026rsquo;t covered. It is much more indepth than this article, but can be confusing in parts. This article is meant to get you acquainted with OpenCore and fill in any missing gaps.\nWhy I Use OpenCore? I use opencore for compatibility and everything can be setup in a non macOS environment. It also injects drivers support (kext) differently than past methods and is far more stable. This also means updates are far less likely to break your system and boot times are just as fast as a regular mac, if not faster. I also find a larger amount of hardware is supported and the finished product is all contained neatly in an EFI partition.\nHardware Compatibility Even with OpenCore supporting a lot more hardware there is still some hardware that simply will not work on macOS no matter what you do. Here is a definitive guide https://dortania.github.io/Anti-Hackintosh-Buyers-Guide/. The TLDR of that guide is the last two generations of nVidia Graphics Cards and future nVidia Cards are not compatible, and even old nVidia cards will not work past High Sierra (10.13.x). Also, almost every Intel Wireless card will not function properly or work at all. So buying a replacement is needed for laptops. AMD CPUs can technically work, but will require more tinkering and are more difficult than the Intel counterparts.\nFiles and Projects you need to download and what they do Here is a list of all the files and GitHub projects that are used for OpenCore.\nOpenCore GitHub (Base Project) - https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases All Drivers, Kexts, and SSDTs - https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/ktext.html GitMacOS GitHub (Download Official Apple PKGs) - https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS ProperTree (config.plist editing) - https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree SSDTTime (DSDT Dump and SSDT creation) - https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime GenSMBIOS (Generate Serial and UUID) - https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS Checklist for https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide Check Hardware Compatibility - Document all device IDs and firmware Download All Projects and Files Boot Into Linux and do a DSDT dump followed by creating SSDT files for your computer (DO NOT USE PREBUILT!)

Feel free to edit the .vimrc to your needs.\nLightLine This plugin adds a nice look to the bottom part of vim and adding a colored line that is now displayed and changes when VIM enters different modes.\nOneDark This is a theme for VIM that adds a greater contrast and dark theme to vim. This makes text and everything inside easier to read.\nFZF (Fuzzy Search) This adds greater functionality to search that allows you to search for partial matches easier. See full syntax here: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#usage\nGoYo This plugin removes all the numbers and formatting and makes it easier when writing documents in VIM. From Normal Mode - I made the hotkey Ctrl+\\ to enter this special format.\nUndoTree UndoTree is an amazing plugin that makes it easy to see everything you have done in your session. Simply press F5 from Normal mode and you will see the entire all your recent changes and undo them.\nNerdTree NerdTree is a file management plugin. This hotkey is Ctrl+o and opens up a file tree on the left side for you switch files\nVimWiki VimWiki adds syntax formatting for markdown and is a fantastic plugin to have if you many markdown files.\nConclusion There is still a ton of other edits I need to make to this VIM and will be a work in progress for many years. Everyday I learn something new and powerful with VIM and if you can think about what you want, I am sure VIM will be able to accommodate that. Future additions that I am looking at is SpellCheck, VIM Tabs, and general improvements to the .vimrc file. My vimrc file currently has a lot of the most common tweaks, longer history, sorting, file numbering, and removal of auto comment formatting, However there is still a of things to improve.

With that said we will be going over the basic structure of BTRFS and the things you should and should not do.\nCreating a BTRFS Filesystem Create the file system on an empty btrfs partition\nmkfs.btrfs /dev/sda1\nNote: You will need to mount this file system after\nNow we need to make a subvolume before we add data to the device\nbtrfs subvolume create /mnt/sda1 /mnt/sda1 is the mount point!\nAfter this is complete you can now write data to your BTRFS volume and use all it capabilities.\nBasic BTRFS Layout\nNote: Top Level 5 is root and isn\u0026rsquo;t a btrfs subvolume that can do snapshots and other btrfs features and therefore should not be mounted\ntoplevel root level 5 +-- root\\@ level 256 (subvolume root mounted at / id varies) +-- root\\.snapshots level 256 (typical snapshot subvolume) Basic Commands Disk free\nsudo btrfs fi show Output:\nDisk Usage\nsudo btrfs fi du / Note: you can make / any other mount point Scrub SubVolume Recommended running every week!\nsudo btrfs scrub start / Balance Subvolume for Performance\nsudo btrfs balance start -musage=50 -dusage=50 /\nNote: Use the musgae and dusage filters to only balance used blocks above 50 percent utilization\nsudo btrfs balance cancel / Stops running balance List Subvolumes based on mountpoint\nsudo btrfs subv list /home Output:\nMount Subvolume\nsudo mount -o subvolid=267 /dev/sda1 /media/games\nOR add this to /etc/fstab\nUUID=IDGOESHERE /media/games rw,exec,subvolid=267 0 0 Snapshots Snapshots are one of the best things about BTRFS and I absolutely love them. They are incredible powerful and beneficial.\nSo Lets run through some scenarios when you use Snapshots.\nCreate Snapshot sudo btrfs subv snapshop /home /home/.snapshots/2020-01-13\nUsing this you can revert the snapshop by simply editing the /etc/fstab and changing the subvol=2020-01-13 or the corresponding subvolid you get from sudo btrfs subv list /home\nRestore Snapshot Restore Snapshop after reboot and successful rollback\nsudo btrfs subv delete /home\nsudo btrfs subv snapshot /home/.snapshots/2020-01-13 /home\nNow simply restore your fstab and reboot to be back on the /home subvolume.\nThe reason to do it using this method is to verify the data first. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work out you can simply change the /etc/fstab back and you will be back to where you started.\nMultiple disks and RAID Oh boy, here we go. This is such a badly misunderstood subject and if you aren\u0026rsquo;t careful you will be causing more problems than you are looking to solve. So with that let\u0026rsquo;s get into RAID. I will NOT be cover RAID 5 as it is unstable and SHOULD NOT BE USED!\nMust know commands for multiple disks:\nAdd Disks before creating subvolume: sudo btrfs device add /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1\nAdd Disk to existing subvolume: sudo btrfs device add /dev/sdb1 /home\nDelete Disk from subvolume: sudo btrfs device delete /dev/sdb1 /home\nCreating the RAID File System:\nRAID 1: sudo btrfs -m raid1 -d raid1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1\nRAID 10: sudo btrfs -m raid10 -d raid10 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1\nConvert to to RAID 1 after adding disk to existing subvolume\nbtrfs balance start -mconvert=raid1 -dconvert=raid1 /home\nI could put RAID 0 here\u0026hellip; but honestly you should just use EXT4 or XFS if you are looking for performance. It would be better than using BTRFS!\nVideo Walkthrough ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/btrfs-guide/","tags":["BTRFS"],"title":"BTRFS Guide - Basic Commands, Snapshots, and RAID"},{"categories":["Linux","Networking"],"contents":"This article goes over the basics of hugo and guides you through the process of using a static site generator.\nInstalling Hugo Arch-Based Users: yay -S hugo\nDebian-Based Users: sudo apt install hugo\nNote: Debian packages are old and I recommend downloading the latest version of hugo from github\nGithub Repo for Hugo (Latest Versions and Notes)\nHugo GitHub\nOfficial Site\nCreate your first site and install a theme using the Quick Start Page.\nCommon Hugo Commands hugo - builds static files in the siteroot/public folder hugo server - runs a test site so you can login to http://127.0.0.1:1313 and see your changes before pushing live hugo new posts/dir/newpost.md - you can make new posts on the fly with all your templates (see below) The First Changes I made several changes when I first switched to HUGO and these were the changes I made.\nTheme Modification I downloaded the the Mainroad Theme and installed it during the Quick Start. Note: My Debian system had an old version of HUGO 0.40 and I had to update before the theme worked.\nChanging Theme Widgets Social Widget I first started to change the social widget by adding YouTube and Twitch from the following file siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/widgets/social.html.\nThe Most challengeing Part of this was the SVG files used by mainroad. However, once I figured out the SVG format can be edited in a simple text editor and I mirrored the size and types from the existing SVG files they showed up.\nHere are the Edits I made to social.html:\n{{- with .Site.Params.widgets.social.twitch }} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;widget-social__item widget__item\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a class=\u0026#34;widget-social__link widget__link btn\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Twitch\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;noopener noreferrer\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;https://twitch.tv/{{ . }}\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{ partial \u0026#34;svg/twitch.svg\u0026#34; (dict \u0026#34;class\u0026#34; \u0026#34;widget-social__link-icon\u0026#34;) }} \u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Twitch Live Streams\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{- end }} Basically after getting the SVG setup and putting the twitch.svg and youtube.svg in this path siteroot/mainroad/layouts/partials/svg I was able to get the Social widget exactly how I wanted.\nTags Widget Next up was fixing the tags on the sidebar. They were blocky and quite ugly, where I wanted a traditional tag cloud that you see on many other sites to help users navigate your content. So I began looking at other projects that had the proper code. I found the following code snippit:\n{{ if not (eq (len $.Site.Taxonomies.tags) 0) }} {{ $fontUnit := \u0026#34;rem\u0026#34; }} {{ $largestFontSize := 2.0 }} {{ $largestFontSize := 2.5 }} {{ $smallestFontSize := 1.0 }} {{ $fontSpread := sub $largestFontSize $smallestFontSize }} {{ $max := add (len (index $.Site.Taxonomies.tags.ByCount 0).Pages) 1 }} {{ $min := len (index $.Site.Taxonomies.tags.ByCount.Reverse 0).Pages }} {{ $spread := sub $max $min }} {{ $fontStep := div $fontSpread $spread }} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;widget-taglist widget\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4 class=\u0026#34;widget__title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ T \u0026#34;tags_title\u0026#34; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;widget__content\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div id=\u0026#34;tag-cloud\u0026#34; style=\u0026#34;padding: 5px 15px\u0026#34;\u0026gt; {{ range $name, $taxonomy := $.Site.Taxonomies.tags }} {{ $currentTagCount := len $taxonomy.Pages }} {{ $currentFontSize := (add $smallestFontSize (mul (sub $currentTagCount $min) $fontStep) ) }} {{ $count := len $taxonomy.Pages }} {{ $weigth := div (sub (math.Log $count) (math.Log $min)) (sub (math.Log $max) (math.Log $min)) }} {{ $currentFontSize := (add $smallestFontSize (mul (sub $largestFontSize $smallestFontSize) $weigth) ) }} \u0026lt;!--Current font size: {{$currentFontSize}}--\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ \u0026#34;/tags/\u0026#34; | relLangURL }}{{ $name | urlize }}\u0026#34; style=\u0026#34;font-size:{{$currentFontSize}}{{$fontUnit}}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ $name }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} After replacing siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/widgets/taglist.html with the following code. The tag cloud was complete.\nHeader/Footer Modification Replacing the Header and footer was extremely easy as it is just plain HTML. The files are located in siteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/header.html or footer.html. You can leave the stock, but I wanted to add a privacy policy and terms of service to be compliant.\nTable of Contents Changes I replaced the title \u0026ldquo;PAGE CONTENTS\u0026rdquo; with share buttons using a share-buttons.html I created. This could all be done in the post-toc.html file, but I wanted to keep it modular and not make too many edits to the theme. Here were my changes:\nsiteroot/themes/mainroad/layouts/partials/post-toc.html\n{{ if .Param \u0026#34;toc\u0026#34; }} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;post__toc toc\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;toc__title\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ partial \u0026#34;share-buttons.html\u0026#34;

I added the following before the \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; of this file to populate AdSense. You could put Analytics in here as well, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t needed since mainroad theme has the option in config.toml.

This is what I have in the file now: baseURL = \u0026quot;https://christitus.com/\u0026quot;\nAnalytics, Social, and Title/Description All of these options worked perfectly and I had no issues.\nMenu The last problem I had was the menu at the top of my theme.

This will teach you how to modify lightdm to choose a default desktop environment, theme, autologin, and even a VNC connection.\nReference Articles:\nUbuntu Wiki\nArch Wiki\nDebian Wiki\nInstallation For Debian based systems, install LightDM by typing sudo apt install lightdm\nFor Arch based systems, install LightDM by typing sudo pacman -S lightdm\nActivating LightDM on startup Before you can enable the lightdm service you will need to disable your current display manager.\nFor disabling SDDM (KDE Systems) type sudo systemctl disable sddm\nFor disabling GDM (Gnome Systems) type sudo systemctl disable gdm\nConfiguration Start out with opening up your /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and this is where most of the modifications will take place.\nI will go over the 4 sections in the configuration that most will want to change or modify.\nChanging the Theme lightdm.conf\n[Seat:*] #type=local #pam-service=lightdm #pam-autologin-service=lightdm-autologin #pam-greeter-service=lightdm-greeter #xserver-command=X #xmir-command=Xmir #xserver-config= #xserver-layout= #xserver-allow-tcp=false #xserver-share=true #xserver-hostname= #xserver-display-number= #xdmcp-manager= #xdmcp-port=177 #xdmcp-key= greeter-session=lightdm-slick-greeter ### CHANGE THIS #greeter-hide-users=false #greeter-allow-guest=true #greeter-show-manual-login=false #greeter-show-remote-login=true Install what ever theme you want, this is called a greeter in lightdm, and then change the line above. After the changes are made you can either reboot or type sudo systemctl restart lightdm Please Note: This will log you out\nChanging the Default Desktop Environment lightdm.conf\n[Seat:*] #type=local #pam-service=lightdm #pam-autologin-service=lightdm-autologin #pam-greeter-service=lightdm-greeter #xserver-command=X #xmir-command=Xmir #xserver-config= #xserver-layout= #xserver-allow-tcp=false #xserver-share=true #xserver-hostname= #xserver-display-number= #xdmcp-manager= #xdmcp-port=177 #xdmcp-key= greeter-session=lightdm-slick-greeter #greeter-hide-users=false #greeter-allow-guest=true #greeter-show-manual-login=false #greeter-show-remote-login=true user-session=default ################ CHANGE THIS #allow-user-switching=true #allow-guest=true #guest-session= To specify a specific desktop environment you need to change the user-session line to be your desktop environment. For example I use the awesome window manager for mine and I put user-session=awesome\nNote: If you don\u0026rsquo;t know the name, the desktop environment list can be found with listing .desktop file from /usr/share/xsessions/*.desktop\nFor complete listing of user sessions type: ls /usr/share/xsessions/*.desktop\nAutoLogin with LightDM Change the following part of the file to autologin. Note: This does pose a security risk and should never be done in a business\nlightdm.conf Under [Seat:*]\nautologin-guest=false autologin-user=username autologin-user-timeout=0 autologin-in-background=false #autologin-session= I generally uncomment the following lines above and just change this line autologin-user=username and then it will autologin that user on the next reboot. Note: You can use the autologin-guest instead of user to have it autologin as a guest account.\nVNC Connection At the buttom of the lightdm.conf file you will see VNC connection information. This information uses the tigervnc package and also is done using secure channel. This means you must establish a SSH connection with a portforward before you can connect to VNC. Example: ssh 192.168.69.10 -L 9901:localhost:5901 This establishes ssh and port forwards your local port 9901 to 5901 of the remote machine. Then you could launch VNC viewer with vncviewer localhost:9901. Even though this says localhost it is forwarding the request through SSH to the remote machine.\nNow with that framework lets look at the conf file:\n# # VNC Server configuration # # enabled = True if VNC connections should be allowed # command = Command to run Xvnc server with # port = TCP/IP port to listen for connections on # listen-address = Host/address to listen for VNC connections (use all addresses if not present) # width = Width of display to use # height = Height of display to use # depth = Color depth of display to use # [VNCServer] #enabled=false #command=Xvnc #port=5900 #listen-address= #width=1024 #height=768 #depth=8 The main things to change here are enabled=true width - height - depth and then you are off. My typical defaults would look like the following:\n[VNCServer] enabled=true command=Xvnc port=5900 #listen-address= width=1920 height=1080 depth=16 Video Walkthrough ","permalink":"https://christitus.com/lightdm-configuration/","tags":["LightDM"],"title":"LightDM Configuration"},{"categories":["Linux","Networking"],"contents":"This will show you how to set up a VPN Kill Switch so all traffic will come from that server.

After looking at the performance below, you will be able to decide which one best suits your needs.\nSATA (Serial Advanced Technology Advancement) * Most common * Least reliable * Slow * 5400 – 7200 RPM Hard Drives * Half duplex (Can’t read and write simultaneously) * 6 GB/s connection * Cheap (1 TB SSD $150) SAS (Serial Attached Storage) Commonplace in data centers Very reliable Error checking is built-in Fast 15k RPM Hard Drives Full Duplex (Simultaneous read and write) 12 GB/s connection Expensive (800 GB SSD $600) – Pretty much enterprise only NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) Common in new PC builds, common in data center SANs for cache on tiered storage. Reliable Fastest 16-32 GB/s connection when directly plugged into PCIe 12 GB/s connection still applies when hot-swapped via SAS connection Full Duplex Higher Bandwidth (Able to process the most at one time) Expensive (1 TB Residential $300-$400 | 1.2 TB Enterprise $1200) No real surprises here but having it bullet-pointed makes the comparison very easy. I hope this helps those trying to decide on what to buy and typical performance you can expect from it.\nSATA vs SAS vs NVMe | Performance Winner: NVMe SATA vs SAS vs NVMe | Budget Winner: SATA What about SAS? Well, in enterprise environments you see this very often with pretty much every tiered storage device having it. Most of what is on the market today is a mixture of SAS and NVMe for business. These hybrid drives are crazy expensive but give system administrators the ability to claim some of the speed from NVMe without purchasing entirely new devices. While this may seem trivial when you are talking thousands of dollars, this becomes a budget issue. SAS also has the error checking built into the interface, which in turn, gives greater reliability in theory. Personally, I think the future enterprise devices will have some type of new connector or housing that will make NVMe devices hot-swappable without the 12 GB/s SAS limitation. That said, we aren’t quite there yet, and the prevalence of SAS in enterprise space will continue.\nBy doing this you allow all traffic inbound to this computer, consequently, all outbound traffic is already allowed by default.

This step-by-step guide shows you the requirements, installation steps, and basic configuration.\nRequirements Microsoft recommends 128 GB of memory. If in a medium size environment (100-1000 users) 32-64 GB will be sufficient. Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2/2016/2019 Co-Existence with Exchange 2013/2016 that are up-to-date 30 GB of free disk space, however, you should have plenty of TBs of storage available for the mailbox stores.

Exchange Admin Console – https://server/ecp – Refined and matches Office 365 layout Outlook Web Access has more features and a better look Things I wished Exchange 2019 had DKIM… seriously, WTF Microsoft. Office 365 has this, therefore exchange 2019 should have this! Installing Exchange 2019 This was a breeze, with only 2 pre-requirements missing on a server 2016 stock install. The only configuration during setup was the role (mailbox or edge) and naming the exchange organization. Check out this video below to see the time lapse install:\nhttps://youtu.be/xmDOdkOKQxQ\nConfiguring Exchange 2019 Again, this was very easy with only a couple options needed before I was operational. Using only a mailbox role with no edge you only need to add your domain, send connector, and set an email address for mailboxes. Here is the basic configuration video:\nhttps://youtu.be/9n6JlEUS5fw\n_Note: Do not forget to add the MX, SPF, DMARC records where your domain registrar DNS resides. _\nConclusion I absolutely love Exchange 2019 due to the vast amount of improvements, that said, I am still bummed that they continue to not support DKIM through exchange server. Installing and configuring exchange 2019 was the easiest experience I’ve had to date, which is saying a lot!

Spoiler: It sucks.\nGreenshot the best Snipping Tool Replacement So what should you use? Greenshot. Its freeware and it just works. Not bulky with a toolbar, but adds a tray icon, which you don’t have to use. You can just press print screen and away you go.\nDownload it from there website here: http://getgreenshot.org/downloads/\nMicrosoft Snip and Sketch Replacement Currently, this is labeled as Screen Sketch, however, this is changing to Snip and Sketch App in the next update.

This is imperative so you can see any performance gains or losses you might incur. There are many times I have been surprised by the results of switching hardware or simply testing older hardware to see how it is holding up.

After wasting a lot of time, more than I’m willing to tell you here, I found out the new version of chrome will default to https:// before everything unless you explicitly put http:// in the address bar. This includes IP addresses and the like. So make sure you have SSL certs updated otherwise you are going to have a bad time. Video Walkthrough Conclusion I typically love a lot of the Google projects and updates they do, but the missing www in the address bar left me a little puzzled and why they thought they needed to do it. On the plus side, I do like the new chrome tabs, so the entire update is not all bad. Also, the changes to default to secure sites has been a long time coming.

Most businesses want to move to the “cloud” but have no idea what that means.\nIf you’re a small business you typically have a couple computers scattered around with one storage device. If you’re a medium or large business you probably already have several servers at a location in a contract. Moving to the cloud is often pitched to businesses using Software-as-a-Service replacing the current system with a web application that runs through your browser. While this is ideal, in most instances it isn’t practical. So you keep paying for a bloated IT infrastructure that is dated, isn’t as reliable, and unable to change with your business needs.\nPerforming a Cloud Migration Leverage Google Cloud Compute, Amazon Web Services, or Microsoft Azure to perform a cloud migration. Moving your servers will often end up costing between $100 – $400 per server a month depending on your environment. When you factor in that there is no capital expenditure, maintenance, or power costs this is a far cheaper solution than your current environment. You also gain a SUBSTANTIAL increase in flexibility, performance, and reliability. So why hasn’t everyone transitioned to these services?\nMigration Pains The main issue is getting a cloud migration completed. It’s hard to find businesses, technicians, or engineers that will do the migration. In the end, you should be paying these companies directly.\nPitfalls\nContracting a company that uses their own hardware and you pay them for substandard service and equipment on a monthly basis. Under-estimating the extended downtime that is required for moving to these services. If you have 30+ servers it will take months for preparation, transfer time, and deployment. Degraded service if you have to work in a hybrid environment. Working through a VPN for an extended time that it takes to complete the full migration. Mass Storage – Most of the cost of using these services come from storage, and typically it’s not till you hit the petabytes that you’d run into ROI issues. As a general rule of thumb, anything less than 1000 Terabytes is more cost-effective using these services. Conclusion I think every business should be leveraging this technology. The larger the business the harder the cloud migration will be. Small businesses I’ve done in the course of a day, whereas larger businesses take considerably longer. Stay the course and keep searching for talent capable of helping with this transition. I enjoy using all three of these major players in the market, however, for Website Hosting and Linux boxes I like Google Cloud Compute the most, and for businesses already running Office 365 Microsoft Azure makes for the easiest transition.\n","permalink":"https://christitus.com/cloud-migration/","tags":["Business","Cloud Migration"],"title":"Cloud migration hosting in Google, Amazon, or Microsoft"},{"categories":["Linux"],"contents":"Use the commands below to create swap file on a micro instance with a Linux operating system.

Sometimes people lost the disc, re-partitioned their drives, or simply had their hard drive fail. This leads to installing windows from scratch and hunting down all your drivers.\nThat is all changing in Windows 8, they are including a “Refresh” option and a “Remove everything and Re-install Windows” option.\nI’m skeptical on how well this works, but in theory, this could be a great thing for the home user. Windows 8 computers are likely to get infected, just as much as a Windows 7 computer. However, having these options at users fingertips could be a blessing or a curse. Imagine if a virus re-programs these features, wouldn’t that be fun 😉 I guess we will just have to wait and see.\n“Refresh your PC” The Windows refresh PC options remove all user-installed applications from 3rd parties, i.e. Adobe products from a disc, Google Chrome, or anything you installed on the “desktop” portion of windows 8. This pretty much erases all applications on your PC, except those from the windows store. You see where I’m going here, don’t you? Microsoft hopes that end users will purchase EVERYTHING from their store, which it can vet and make sure it doesn’t have viruses. Microsoft will, of course, take a piece of the pie on that purchase and is why Windows 8 will be so cheap. I have mixed emotions on this, but it does make a lot of sense.\n“Remove Everything and Reinstall Windows” This will be nice to have it part of the operating system. It should have been there on past windows, but better late than never. A simple reformats, and reload without the need to hunt down the correct windows disc.\nOverall, I’m happy to see Microsoft taking steps to transition the computer world away from where we have been.

I’m looking forward to the official launch next month.\nTo Learn more about Windows Refresh PC and Restoring custom images go to http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/04/refresh-and-reset-your-pc.aspx\nThis details creating a custom refresh image which would include 3rd party applications.
